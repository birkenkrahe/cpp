- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

- *Algorithms* are the core of programming

- Example for an algorithm: /"When you come to a STOP sign, stop."/

- The human form of algorithm is *heuristics*

- Example for a heuristic: /"To get to the college, go straight."/

- For *programming*, you need both algorithms and heuristics

- Useful tools to master when designing algorithms:
  - *Pseudocode* (task flow description)
  - *Visual modeling* (task flow visualization)

* Operators in C

- Mathematically, operators are really functions: ~f(i,j)=i+j~

- C has many operators, both unary (~-1~) and binary (~1+1~)

- Types of operators in C:

  | OPERATOR            | WHY                   | EXAMPLES  | EXPRESSION |
  |---------------------+-----------------------+-----------+------------|
  | Arithmetic          | compute               | * + - / % | i * j + k  |
  | Relational          | compare               | < > <= >= | i > j      |
  | Equality            | compare (in/equality) | ~==~ ~!=~     | i == j     |
  | Logical             | confirm (truth)       | &&        | i && j     |
  | Assignment          | change                | =         | i = j      |
  | Increment/decrement | change stepwise       | ++, +-    | ++i        |

- Conditional operators used in C are important for program flow:

  | OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION              | EXPRESSION | BOOLEAN VALUE |
  |----------+--------------------------+------------+---------------|
  | ==       | Equal                    | 5 == 5     | true          |
  | !=       | Not equal                | 5 != 5     | false         |
  | >        | Greater than             | 5 > 5      | false         |
  | <        | Less than                | 5 < 5      | false         |
  | >=       | Greater than or equal to | 5 >= 5     | true          |
  | <=       | Less than or equal to    | 5 <= 5     | true          |

- The value of an evaluated conditional operator is *Boolean*
  (logical) - e.g. ~2==2~ evaluates as ~TRUE~ or ~1~.

- Different programming languages differ greatly rgd. operators. For
  example, in the language R, the ~|>~ operator ("pipe") passes a data
  set to a function[fn:1].

  #+begin_example R
  ## pipe data set into function
  mtcars |> head()  ## same as head(mtcars)
  #+end_example

  Output:
  #+begin_example
             mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4
Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4
Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1

  #+end_example

- You already met the ~>~ and ~>>~ operators of the ~bash~ shell language
  that redirects standard output to a file:

  #+begin_example bash
    ## create empty file called "empty"
    > empty
  #+end_example
  
* Boolean algebra

- [ ] What is algebra about?[fn:2]

- Algebra allows you to form small worlds with fixed laws so that
  you know exactly what's going on - what the output must be for a
  given input. This certainty is what is responsible for much of the
  magic of mathematics.

- Boole's (or Boolean) algebra, or the algebra of logic, uses the
  values of TRUE (or 1) and FALSE (or 0) and the operators AND (or
  "conjunction"), OR (or "disjunction"), and NOT (or "negation").

- Truth tables are the traditional way of showing Boolean scenarios:

  #+name: AND
  | p     | q     | p AND q   |
  |-------+-------+-----------|
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE      |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE     |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE     |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE     |

  #+name: OR
  | p     | q     | p OR q |
  |-------+-------+--------|
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE   |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE   |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE   |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE  |

  #+name: NOT
  | p     | NOT p    |
  |-------+----------|
  | TRUE  | FALSE    |
  | FALSE | TRUE     |

- Using the three basic operators, other operators can be built. In
  electronics, and modeling, the "exclusive OR" operator or "XOR",
  is e.g. equivalent to (p AND NOT q) OR (NOT p AND q)

  #+name: XOR
  | p     | q     | p XOR q | P = p AND (NOT q) | Q = (NOT p) AND q | P OR Q |
  |-------+-------+---------+-------------------+-------------------+--------|
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | FALSE   | FALSE             | FALSE             | FALSE  |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE    | TRUE              | FALSE             | TRUE   |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | TRUE    | FALSE             | TRUE              | TRUE   |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE   | FALSE             | FALSE             | FALSE  |

- XOR is the operator that we've used in our BPMN models for
  pseudocode as a gateway operator - only one of its outcomes can be
  true but never both of them

- Algebraic operations are more elegant and insightful than truth
  tables. Watch "Proving Logical Equivalences without Truth Tables"
  [[logic][(2012)]] as an example.

* Order of operator operations

- In compound operations (multiple operators), you need to know the
  order of operator precedence

- C has almost 50 operators. The most unusual are compound
  increment/decrement operators[fn:3]:

  | STATEMENT  | COMPOUND | PREFIX | POSTFIX |
  |------------+----------+--------+---------|
  | i = i + 1; | i += 1;  | ++i;   | i++;    |
  | j = j - 1; | j -= 1;  | --i;   | i--;    |

- ~++~ and ~--~ have side effects: they modify the values of their
  operands: the /prefix/ operator ~++i~ increments ~i+1~ and then fetches
  the value ~i~:

  #+name: prefix
  #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
    int i = 1;
    printf("i is %d\n", ++i);  // prints "i is 2"
    printf("i is %d\n", i);  // prints "i is 2"
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: prefix
  : i is 2
  : i is 2
  

- The /postfix/ operator ~++j~ also means ~j = j + 1~ but here, the value of
  ~j~ is fetched, and then incremented.

  #+name: postfix
  #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
    int j = 1;
    printf("j is %d\n", j++);  // prints "j is 1"
    printf("j is %d\n", j);  // prints "j is 2"
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: postfix
  : j is 1
  : j is 2

- Here is another illustration with an assignment of post and prefix
  increment operators:

  #+name: postfixprefix
  #+begin_src C :exports both :results output
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 0;
    puts("start: num1 = 10, num2 =0");

    num2 = num1++;
    printf("num2 = num1++, so num2 = %d, num1 = %d\n", num2, num1);

    num1 = 10;
    num2 = ++num1;
    printf("num2 = ++num1, so num2 = %d, num1 = %d\n", num2, num1);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: postfixprefix
  : start: num1 = 10, num2 =0
  : num2 = num1++, so num2 = 10, num1 = 11
  : num2 = ++num1, so num2 = 11, num1 = 11

- The table [[order]] shows a partial list of operators and their
  order of precedence from 1 (highest precedence, i.e. evaluated
  first) to 5 (lowest precedence, i.e. evaluated last)

  #+name: order
  | ORDER | OPERATOR            | SYMBOL           | ASSOCIATIVITY |
  |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
  |     1 | increment (postfix) | ~++~               | left          |
  |       | decrement (postfix) | ~--~               |               |
  |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
  |     2 | increment (prefix)  | ~++~               | right         |
  |       | decrement (prefix)  | ~--~               |               |
  |       | unary plus          | ~+~                |               |
  |       | unary minus         | ~-~                |               |
  |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
  |     3 | multiplicative      | ~* / %~            | left          |
  |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
  |     4 | additive            | ~+ -~              | left          |
  |-------+---------------------+------------------+---------------|
  |     5 | assignment          | ~= *= /= %= += -=~ | right         |

- Left/right /associativity/ means that the operator groups from
  left/right. Examples:

  #+name: associativity
  | EXPRESSION | EQUIVALENCE | ASSOCIATIVITY |
  |------------+-------------+---------------|
  | i - j - k  | (i - j) - k | left          |
  | i * j / k  | (i * j) / k | left          |
  | -+j        | - (+j)      | right         |
  | i %=j      | i = (i % j) | right         |
  | i +=j      | i = (j + 1) | right         |

- Write some of these out yourself and run examples. I found ~%=~ quite
  challenging: a modulus and assignment operator. ~i %= j~ computes ~i%j~
  (i modulus j) and assigns it to ~i~.

- What is the value of ~i = 10~ after running the code below?

  #+name: %=
  #+begin_src C :exports both
    int i = 10, j = 5;
    i %= j; // compute modulus of i and j and assigns it to i
    printf("i was 10 and is now %d = 10 %% 5\n", i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: %=
  : i was 10 and is now 0 = 10 % 5

- Check the file type with ~file~
- Display the first 2 lines with ~head~

#+begin_src bash :results output
  wget tinyurl.com/2y6wut43 -O ops.org -o log
  file ops.org
  head -n 2 ops.org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ops.org: cannot open `ops.org\015' (No such file or directory)
: #+title: cc-practice-ops
: #+AUTHOR: [yourName] (pledged)

** TODO Booleans in C

- C evaluates all non-zero values as ~TRUE~ (~1~), and all zero values as
  ~FALSE~ (~0~):

  #+name: boolean
  #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
    if (3) {
      puts("3 is TRUE"); // non-zero expression
     }
    if (!!0) puts("0 is FALSE"); // !0 is literally non-zero
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: boolean
  : 3 is TRUE

- The Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT are represented in C by
  the logical operators ~&&~, ~||~ and ~!~, respectively

** TODO ! operator (logical NOT)

- The ! operator is a "unary" operator that is evaluated from the
  left. It is ~TRUE~ when its argument is ~FALSE~ (~0~), and it is ~FALSE~
  when its argument is ~TRUE~ (non-zero).

- [X] If ~i = 100~, what is ~!i~?

  The Boolean value of ~100~ is TRUE. Therefore, ~!100~ = ~!TRUE~ = ~FALSE~

- [X] If ~j = 1.0e-15~, what is ~!j~?

  The Boolean value of ~1.0e-15~ is TRUE. Therefore, ~!1.0e-15~ = ~!TRUE~ =
  ~FALSE~

- [ ] Let's check!

  #+name: negation
  #+begin_src C :results output :exports both
    // declare and assign variables
    int i = 100;
    double j = 1.e-15;
    // print output
    printf("!%d is %d because %d is non-zero!\n", i, !i, i);
    printf("!(%.1e) is %d because %.1e is non-zero!\n", j, !j, j);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: negation
  : !100 is 0 because 100 is non-zero!
  : !(1.0e-015) is 0 because 1.0e-015 is non-zero!

** TODO && operator (logical AND)

- Evaluates a Boolean expression from left to right

- Its value is ~TRUE~ if and only if *both* sides of the operator are ~TRUE~

- [X] Example: guess the outcome first

  #+name: &&_op_true
  #+begin_src C :exports both
    if ( 3 > 1 && 5 == 10 )
      printf("The expression is TRUE.\n");
     else
       printf("The expression is FALSE.\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: &&_op_true
  : The expression is FALSE.

- [ ] Example: guess the outcome first
  #+name: &&_op_false
  #+begin_src C :exports both
    if (3 < 5 && 5 == 5 )
      printf("The expression is TRUE.\n");
     else
       printf
         ("The expression is FALSE.\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: &&_op_false
  : The expression is TRUE.

** TODO || operator (logical OR)

- Evaluates a Boolean expression from left to right

- It is ~FALSE~ if and only *both* sides of the operator are ~FALSE~

- It is ~TRUE~ if either side of the operator is ~TRUE~

- [X] Example: guess the outcome first

  #+name: ||_op_true
  #+begin_src C :exports both
    if ( 3 > 5 || 5 == 5 )
      printf("The expression is TRUE.\n");
     else
       printf("The expression is FALSE.\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ||_op_true
  : The expression is TRUE.

- [X] Example: guess the outcome first

  #+name: ||_op_false
  #+begin_src C :exports both
    if ( 3 > 5 || 6 < 5 )
      printf("The expression is TRUE.\n");
     else
       printf("The expression is FALSE.\n");
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ||_op_false
  : The expression is FALSE.

** TODO Checking for upper and lower case

- Characters are represented by ASCII[fn:4] character sets

- E.g. ~a~ and ~A~ are represented by the ASCII codes 97 and 65,
  resp.

- Let's check that.

  #+name: ascii_input
  #+begin_src bash :results silent
    echo "a A" > ./src/ascii
    cat ./src/ascii
  #+end_src

  In [[ascii]], two characters are scanned and then printed as characters
  and as integers:
  
  #+name: ascii
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ./src/ascii :results output :export both
    char c1, c2;
    scanf("%c %c", &c1, &c2);
    printf("The ASCII value of %c is %d\n", c1, c1);
    printf("The ASCII value of %c is %d\n", c2, c2);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ascii
  : The ASCII value of a is 97
  : The ASCII value of A is 65

- User-friendly programs should use compound conditions to check for
  both lower and upper case letters:

  #+name: ascii_both
  #+begin_example C
  if (response == 'A' || response == 'a')
  #+end_example

** TODO Checking for a range of values

- To validate input, you often need to check a range of values

- This is a common use of compound conditions, logical and
  relational operators

- We first create an input file ~num~ with a number in it.

  #+name: valid_input
  #+begin_src bash :results silent
    echo 5 > ./src/num
    cat ./src/num
  #+end_src

- [ ] What does the code in [[validate]] do? Will it run? What will the
  output be for our choice of input?

  #+name: validate
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ./src/num :exports both

    int response = 0; // declare and initialize integer

    scanf("%d", &response);  // scan integer input

    // check if input was in range or not
    if ( response < 1 || response > 10 ) {
      puts("Number not in range.");
     } else {
      puts("Number in range.");
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: validate
  : Number in range.

- How can you translate a range like ~![1,10]~ into a conditional
  expression? It means that we want to test if a number is outside of
  the closed interval ~[1,10]~.

- The numbers that fulfil this condition are smaller than 1 or greater
  than 10, hence the condition is ~x < 1 || x > 10~.

- This is more conveniently written as ~x < 1 || 10 < x~.

[fn:1]Only from R version 4.1 - before that, you have to use the
magrittr pipe operator ~%>%~.

[fn:2]Algebra is the branch of mathematics that allows you to
represent problems in the form of abstract, or formal,
expressions. The abstraction is encapsulated in the notion of a
variable (an expression of changing value), and of an operator acting
on one or more variables (a function having the variable as an
argument, and using it to compute something).

[fn:3]These operators were inherited from Ken Thompson's earlier B
language. They are not faster just shorter and more convenient.
