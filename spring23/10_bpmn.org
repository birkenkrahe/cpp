* README

- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

* Process models

- [X] Understand what a process manager (software) is and does
- [X] Learn the basics of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
- [X] Learn how to create simple models in BPMN
- [X] Apply modeling skills to creating pseudocode models
- [X] Adding Pseudocode/BPMN models to future programming assignments
  will give you bonus points (5 extra points per assignment)

* Overview

- Flowcharts are popular among computing analysts and programmers

- Flowcharts are a special case of *process models*

- Process modeling is a key 21st century skill, because *process* is the
  central paradigm of modern work organization

- Rather than use flowcharts, we use BPMN - Business Process Model and
  Notation - see figure [[bpmnfig]] below for an overview of the whole
  language (you can get this poster at [[https://www.signavio.com/downloads/short-reads/free-bpmn-2-0-poster/][SAP Signavio]]).

* SAP Signavio

- [[https://signavio.com][SAP Signavio]] is a state-of-the-art process modeling environment

- It includes process mining and workflow management tools. The figure
  [[signavio]] below shows the app dashboard.

- [X] Use the link in Schoology to register

* Points to remember

- Every model needs a pool = process owner
- Conditions become gateways
- Use active sentences for tasks
- When the flow is split, it must be rejoined
- All elements must be named
- Do not change the size of elements
- All elements can be "overloaded"

* BPMN elements

- Roles (pools, lanes, participants)
- Tasks (things to do)
- Events (status)
- Flow (between tasks or events)
- Gateways (decision points, condition check)

* Let's practice

Download the [raw] Org-mode file ~bpmn.org~ from GitHub:

#+begin_src bash
  wget tinyurl.com/58mw8wuc -O bpmn.org -o log
  file bpmn.org
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: bpmn.org: ASCII text

Download the [raw] image file ~battle.png~ from GitHub

#+begin_src bash :results output
  wget tinyurl.com/2s3f3t9c -O battle.png -o log
  file battle.png
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: battle.png: PNG image data, 627 x 367, 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced

The new ~file~ command provides file type information. It should tell
you that ~bpmn.org~ is a ~text~, and that ~battle.png~ is a ~PNG~ file.

Now open the file ~bpmn.org~ in Emacs.
