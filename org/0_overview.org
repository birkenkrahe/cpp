- We have a *textbook* - King, C Programming - A modern approach (2008)
- We have an *operating system* - Linux (if you're lucky), Windows/MacOS
- We have (more than) an *editor* - Emacs + Org-mode
- We have a *compiler* - GCC ([[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cc/piHome/img/0_gcc_mac.png][also on a Mac]])

How can I install the GNU gcc compiler on MacOS?

To install the GNU =gcc= compiler on MacOS, you can use the =Homebrew=
package manager. Follow these steps:

1. Open a Terminal window.

2. Install Homebrew by entering the following command and following
   the on-screen instructions:
#+begin_example
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
#+end_example
3. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install gcc by entering the
   following command:
#+begin_example
brew install gcc
#+end_example
This will install the latest version of gcc available through Homebrew.

4. After the installation is complete, you can verify that gcc is
   installed by running the following command:
#+begin_example
gcc --version
#+end_example
This command should display the version of gcc that you have installed.

That's it! You should now have the GNU gcc compiler installed on your
MacOS system.

* GCC installation on Windows

Step-by-step instructions for installing MinGW via MSYS2:

Step 1: Download MSYS2 installer
- Go to the MSYS2 website: https://www.msys2.org/
- Download the installer

Step 2: Run the installer
- Double-click on the downloaded installer to run it.
- Choose the installation directory (the default is usually fine).
- Click "Next" and then "Install" to start the installation.
- The installer will download and install the necessary files. This
  may take some time, so be patient.

Step 3: Update MSYS2
- After the installation is complete, you'll see an MSYS2
  terminal. Type the following command after the `$` prompt, and press
  Enter:
  #+begin_example
     pacman -Syu
  #+end_example
- This will update the MSYS2 installation with the latest
  packages. Follow the prompts and press Enter when asked.
- For updates (using the same command), add the MYSYS2 terminal to
  your taskbar and run the update regularly.

Step 4: Install MinGW
- Once the update is finished, you can install MinGW by typing the
  following command and pressing Enter:
  #+begin_example
  pacman -S gcc
  #+end_example
- Follow the prompts and press Enter when asked.
- This step can take a few minutes, be patient.

Step 5: Test the installation
- To test if MinGW is installed correctly, open a new MSYS2 terminal.
- Type the following command and press Enter:
  #+begin_example
  gcc --version
  #+end_example
- You should see the version of GCC (the GNU Compiler Collection)
  installed with MinGW.
- If you see the version number, congratulations! MinGW is installed
  and ready to use.

Step 6: Put MSYS2 in the ~PATH~ of your PC
- Type ~PATH~ in your Windows search field and open "Edit the system
  environment variables".
- Click on the "Environment Variables..." button.
- In the "System variables" menu, find the line for "Path" with your
  cursor, and click "Edit".
- In the menu, click "New" and enter ~C:\msys64\mingw64\bin~.
- Click "OK" for all three menus.
- You can now execute ~gcc~ from anywhere on your computer (e.g. from
  inside Emacs, or from the Windows CMD line).

That's it! You have successfully installed MinGW via MSYS2. You can
now use MinGW to compile and run C/C++ programs on your system.

[[../img/0_github.png]]

- GitHub is the most popular software development platform but not
  just for programmers (cp. [[https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14108][Braga et al., 2023]])

- It's now owned by Microsoft (which is becoming a problem)

- Here for you: all course materials, and the course FAQ

- To get some bonus points, watch "How GitHub works", complete the
  "Hello world exercise" on the GitHub platform and [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/23317][submit the result]].

* The (feared) Emacs editor & Literate Programming
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: My GitHub dashboard
[[../img/0_litprog.png]]

"Story + code = source code + documentation"
- Humans can't read machine code - they require stories.
- Literate programming delivers human-readable programs.
- Emacs + Org-mode is our platform to do this.

* What are we going to do besides programming? 
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Layers between you and a document on your computer (DALL-E3)
[[../img/0_infrastructure.png]]

- There are many layers between your input and the CPU.
- Most of the software enabling you to do stuff is written in C.
- The primary software to connect to the OS is the shell program.

Does anybody know what a "shebang" in computing is?[fn:1]

* Practice: first C program! (15 min)
Let's set emacs up, write and run a first "literate" c program! it is
very important that you enter everything *exactly as shown*. if you get
something wrong just go back one step. Contact me if you need me after
checking with your neighbor if he or she can help.

1) Open the command line terminal with ~cmd~ in the search field and pin
   the app to the task bar to open it more quickly next time.

2) At the prompt, type ~gcc --version~ - this should tell you the
   location of the C compiler, GNU CC.

3) Open the Windows search field and type ~notepad~, then open the
   app. You can also pin it to the taskbar. This is your editor now.

4) Pin the terminal to your taskbar to open it quickly next time!

5) In the ~notepad~ app window, enter the following lines - don't miss
   a single character, including empty 'whitespace':
   #+begin_example
     #include <stdio.h>

     int main (void)
     {
        puts("Hello, world!");
        return 0;
     }
   #+end_example

6) Save the file with ~CTRL + s~ to the name: ~hello.c~. Pay attention to
   the file location on your computer, e.g. ~This PC > Downloads~.

7) Close the ~notepad~ app.

8) Open the CMD line terminal again.

9) Go to the location of your ~hello.c~ file by entering ~cd~ followed by
   the location, e.g. ~cd Downloads~ or ~cd C:\~.

10) Make sure your file is there and ready by entering ~type
    hello.c~. You should now see it on the screen.

11) Compile the program by entering ~gcc hello.c~. If all is well,
    you'll get no response, just another prompt.

12) At the prompt, enter ~DIR hello.c a.exe~ - this will give you
    information about your C file and the executable machine file.

13) Run the program by entering ~a.exe~.

14) Now compile the program again with the command ~gcc hello.c -o hello~.

15) Your executable (the compiler's output) is now called ~hello~.

16) Check that by entering ~hello~ at the prompt. You should get your
    output ~Hello, world!~ on the screen.

17) Now open ~hello.c~ again using ~notepad~ and at the top add the line:
    #+begin_example
    // Hello world program by [yourname] (Pledged)
    #+end_example

18) Save it again and submit it as your first in-class assignment:
    1. Open a browser to GDrive and upload the file
    2. Open the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/22790][assignment in Canvas]] at lyon.instructure.com
    3. Upload the file from GDrive (click on "~More~")
    4. When you see it attached, click on ~Submit Assignment~.

* What did you just learn?

You learnt:
1) How to open and close a command line (aka shell) on Windows.
2) How to check the version of the C compiler =gcc=.
3) How to list, display, and move files from the command line.
4) How to create, compile, and run a C program.
5) How to save a file on your GDrive.
6) How to submit a completed assignment to Canvas.

It would be worth repeating these steps on your own without peeking in
your notes to make sure that you understood what you did and that you
can do it again - we'll do this hundreds of times in class!

You can watch me complete this exercise [[https://youtu.be/zRgIaJzrbnY?si=NwOl0u9Nr06FkkoU][in this video]] (30').
