* Simple and nested 'if' structures

- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- All available material is in GitHub.

* Overview and example

- ~If~ statement structure in C is very similar to pseudocode "~If~"

- The code block [[battle1]] is the C version of the pseudocode:
  #+name: battle1
  #+begin_example C
  // checks if health is smaller or equal 100
  if (health <= 100)  
    // drink health potion if condition is TRUE
  else
    //resume battle if condition is FALSE
  #+end_example

- Differences: condition needs /parentheses/ ~(...)~; no "~end if~" statement

- The ~health~ check results in a /Boolean/ answer: true (~1~) or false (~0~)

- Unlike other languages, there are no Boolean types =TRUE=, =FALSE=

- To run, the program needs a /declaration/ of the ~health~ variable

- /Multiple statements/ need to be included in braces ~{...}~

- The source code [[battle2]] will run. The variable has been declared
  and initialized:
  #+name: battle2
  #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output
    int health = 99;

    if (health <= 100) {
      // drink health potion
      puts("This is what you do:");
      printf("Drinking health potion!\n");
     }
     else {
       // resume battle
       puts("This is what you do:");
       printf("Resuming battle!\n");
     }
  #+end_src

* Stacked vs. nested IF structures

- In the example [[ex:single]], the stacked =if= statements are evaluated
  independently, case by case. It does not matter if any of them
  fails. The =switch= control structure (next) is built this way.
  #+name: ex:single
  #+begin_example C
       if ( i == 1 )
       // do one thing

       if ( i == 2)
       // do another thing
  #+end_example

  The figure [[fig:singleif]] shows the BPMN model for this program:
  #+name: fig:singleif
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Single IF statements
  [[../img/single.png]]

- In the example [[ex:nestedif]], the second part of the IF statement is
  entered only if the first condition fails.
  #+name: ex:nestedif
  #+begin_example C
     if ( i == 1 ) {
        // do one thing
     }
     else if ( i == 2) {
        // do another thing
     }
  #+end_example

-  The figure [[fig:nestedif]] shows the BPMN model for this program:
  #+name: fig:nestedif
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  #+caption: Single IF statements
  [[../img/nested.png]]

- Which one of these you implement, depends strongly on the problem
  and on your performance requirements (they're quite different in
  speed - which you do you think performs better?[fn:1])

* Let's practice!

- Open the Emacs browser with ~M-x eww~ and enter the URL
  [[https://tinyurl.com/ifelse-org][tinyurl.com/ifelse-org]]

- Save the file with ~C-x C-w~ as ~ifelse.org~

- Close the buffer with ~C-x k~ and reopen the file with ~C-x C-f~

- Add your own name at the top and pledge

- Complete the file

- Submit the completed file to Canvas

[fn:1]Answer: in this case (with mutually exclusive conditions), the
nested statement (=if =... =else=) is generally more efficient because
only one of the statements has to be checked, not both.
