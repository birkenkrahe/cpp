* README

- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

* Overview

- *Pseudocode* is a method to write down/analyze an /algorithm/ or a
  /heuristic/ without having to bother with /syntax/ (like ~&i~ vs. ~i~)

- The prefix pseudo- comes from Ancient Greek [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%88%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%B4%CE%AE%CF%82][ψευδής]], meaning
  "lying", "false" or "untrue", as in "pseudoscience" or "pseudonym"

- Pseudocode does not need to compile or run so it is closer to a
  heuristic than to an exact algorithm.

- Code however needs to be exact and is always algorithmic.

- *Always start with pseudocode* before coding, and when you're stuck
  (not because of syntax ignorance) go back to pseudocode.

* Algorithms vs. heuristic

The heuristic method à la George Pólya in four steps:

* Pseudocode example

- Example: player problem statement in [[problem1]] below:
  #+name: problem1
  #+begin_quote
  "Drink a health potion when a character's health is 100 or
  less. If health reaches 100 or more, resume battle."
  #+end_quote

- Given the problem [[problem1]], this is the pseudocode [[pseudocode1 ]][fn:1]:
  #+name: pseudocode1
  #+begin_example C
  if health is less than 100
    Drink health potion
  else
    Resume battle
  end if
  #+end_example

- The code in [[pseudocode1]] would not compile as a C program (you can
  test yourself: which mistakes would the compiler find?[fn:2])

- The conceptual "trick" with generating pseudocode from a prose
  description is to identify the *logical condition* so that you can
  perform a comparison (= apply a *conditional operator*)

- The pseudocode [[pseudocode1]] leads to the condition ~health < 100~:
  #+name: pseudocode11
  #+begin_example C
  if health < 100
    Drink health potion
  else
    Resume battle
  end if
  #+end_example
- Notice that you could also use another operator: ~>=~ This operator
  would have had the same effect but it is not what you were supposed
  to code. How would the pseudocode change with ~health >= 100~?
  #+name: pseudocode12
  #+begin_example C
  if health >= 100
    Resume battle
  else
    Drink health potion
  end if
  #+end_example

- *Rule:* when making models (via *abstraction*), always stay as close to
  the *problem* description as possible - in terms of *language*, *logic*,
  *tone*, etc  If you're unsure, *ask* (your client/professor/colleague).

- In the pseudocode example above, what relates to 1) language, 2)
  logic, and 3) tone? And 4) are there other specifications?[fn:3]

* Footnotes

[fn:1]In Org mode, you can use the language as an example header
argument to enable syntax highlighting. For pseudocode, this will of
course not work perfectly, since most syntax elements are not in C.

[fn:2]Undeclared variable ~health~, missing closure semi-colons after
the statements, functions ~Drink~ and ~Resume~ not known, and more.

[fn:3] 1) Language: words used like ~health~, ~drink~ or ~resume~. 2) Logic:
[[https://ifttt.com/][IFTTT]] (If This Then That). 3) Tone: game language 'drink health
potion' as function ~drink_health_potion~. 4) The indentation and the
use of ~if else end if~ instead of, e.g. "WHEN health < 100 THEN drink
health potion OTHERWISE resume battle".
