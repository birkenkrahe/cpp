* README

- This script introduces C arrays - an important /data structure/.

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

- This section, including some sample code, is based on chapter 6 in
  Davenport/Vine (2015) and chapter 8 in King (2008).

* Overview

- Variables that can hold only a single data item (a number or a
  character, which is a number, too) are called *scalars*: ~1~, ~'a'~

- In mathematics, /ordered tuples/ of data (x_{1},...x_{n}) are called
  *vectors*. In the R code below,a vector ~v~ is defined and printed:
  #+name: Rvec
  #+begin_src R
    c(1,2,3) -> v ## create a vector of three numbers
    v
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Rvec
  : [1] 1 2 3

- In C there are two *aggregate* stuctures that can store /collections/
  of values: *arrays* and *structures*.

- A *structure* is a forerunners of a /class/, a concept that becomes
  central in C++. Classes contain objects and their properties.

- Different programming languages have different data structures. The
  language Python has *dictionaries*, the language R has *data frames*,
  and the language Lisp has *lists*:

- Example with Python: a /dictionary/ of car data.
  #+name: PyDict
  #+begin_src python :python python3
    thisDict = {
        "brand": "Ford",     # key: brand attribute, value: Ford
        "model": "Mustang",  # key: model attribute, value: Mustang
        "year": 1964         # key: year attribute, value: 1964
    }
    for key, value in thisDict.items():
        print(f"key: {key}, value: {value}")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: PyDict
  : key: brand, value: Ford
  : key: model, value: Mustang
  : key: year, value: 1964

- Example with R: a /data frame/ of tooth growth data, consisting of
  three different vectors of the same length but different data
  types.
  #+name: Rdf
  #+begin_src R
    str(ToothGrowth)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: Rdf
  : 'data.frame':       60 obs. of  3 variables:
  :  $ len : num  4.2 11.5 7.3 5.8 6.4 10 11.2 11.2 5.2 7 ...
  :  $ supp: Factor w/ 2 levels "OJ","VC": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...
  :  $ dose: num  0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5 ...

- For Lisp, /lists/ are the fundamental data structure:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq my-list '(1 2 3 4 5))
    (message "List contents: %s" my-list)
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : List contents: (1 2 3 4 5)

* What is an array?

- An *array* is a /data structure/ containing a number of data values,
  all of which have the same type (like ~int~, ~char~ or ~float~).

- You can visualize arrays as box collections.
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  #+caption: Arrays of different dimensions with values in them
  [[../img/arrays.png]]

- The computer stores them differently - sequentially as a set of
  memory addresses.
  #+name: fig:storage
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  #+caption: Memory representation of a 2D character array (Source: TheCguru.com)
  [[../img/storage.png]]

* One-dimensional arrays

- The simplest kind of array has one dimension - conceptually
  arranged visually in a single row (or column).
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  #+caption: Visualization of a 1-dim array 'a' (Source: King)
  [[../img/one.png]]

- Each element of an array of type T is treated as if it were a
  variable of type T:
  #+name: ex:oneDimArrays
  #+begin_example C
    for ( int i = 0; i < N; i++ )
      a[i] = 0;                    /* clears a */

    for ( int i = 0; i < N; i++ )
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);          /* reads data into a */

    for ( int i = 0; i < N; i++ )
      sum += a[i];                 /* sums the elements of a */
                                   /* sum += a[i] => sum = sum + a[i] */
    #+end_example

* Declaring arrays

- To declare an array, we must specify the /type/ and /number/ of its
  elements, e.g. for an array of 10 elements:
  #+name: pgm:arrayDef
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10];           // declare array a of 10 integers
    printf("a[0] = %d\na[9] = %d\n",
           a[1], a[9]);  // print two array elements
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:arrayDef
  : a[0] = 0
  : a[9] = 0

- The array must be initialized, just like any scalar variable, to
  be of use to us (otherwise strange values may appear):
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10];
    for (int i=0;i<10;i++) printf("%d ",a[i]);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2 0 -1075053569 0 635131049 32767 100 0 4096 0

- You can initialize arrays explicitly using ~{...}~:
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int int_array[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};  // initialize with integers
    double double_array[] = {2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5}; // initialize with floats
    char char_array[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'}; // initialize with chars
  #+end_src
  This is how ~char_array~ looks like (the last character ~\0~ is only a
  terminating character):
  #+attr_html: :width 600px
  [[../img/hello.png]]

- Control over start/finish of arrays is essential, otherwise you
  incur a so-called /memory overflow/:
#+begin_src C
  char c1[] = {'h','e','l','l','o','\0'}; // initialize with chars
  char c2[] = {'h','e','l','l','o'}; // initialize with chars
  printf("%s\n%s",c1,c2);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: hello
: hellohello

* Array length

- An array can have any length. Since the length may have to be
  adjusted, it can be useful to define it as a macro with ~#define~.
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    #define N 10  // directive to define N = 10 everywhere
    int a[N]; // declare array of length N
  #+end_src
- Remember that now ~N~ will *blindly* be replaced by ~10~ *everywhere* in the
  program by the pre-processor.

* Array subscripting side effects
** C is too permissive

- C does not require that the subscript bounds be checked.

- If a subscript goes out of bounds, the program's behavior is
  undefined.

- An array subscript may be an integer expression, therefore it's easy
  to miss subscript violations.
  #+begin_example C
    foo[i+j*10] = 0; // e.g. i=-10, j=1 => foo[0]
    bar[i++];        // e.g. i = -1 => bar[0]
  #+end_example

** Weird ~while~ loop

- As an example for the weird effects, trace this code:
  #+name: trace
  #+begin_example C
    i = 0;
    while ( i < N )
       a[i++] = 0;
  #+end_example
- After ~i~ is set to ~0~, the ~while~ statement checks whether ~i~ is less
  than ~N~: to test this, we need to introduce a support variable.
  #+name: pgm:arrayTest
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10
    int i = 0, a[N]; int j;
    while ( i < N ) {
      printf("%d < N\t", i);  // print condition
      j = i;  // support variable
      a[i++] = 0; // store 0 in a[i] then i = i + 1
      printf("a[%d] = %d\n", j, a[j]); // print i then a[i]
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:arrayTest
  #+begin_example
  0 < N a[0] = 0
  1 < N a[1] = 0
  2 < N a[2] = 0
  3 < N a[3] = 0
  4 < N a[4] = 0
  5 < N a[5] = 0
  6 < N a[6] = 0
  7 < N a[7] = 0
  8 < N a[8] = 0
  9 < N a[9] = 0
  #+end_example

- Without the support variable, we would get weird printing results:
  can you explain them?
  #+name: pgm:arrayTest1
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 10
    int i = 0, a[N];
    while ( i < N ) {
      printf("%d < N\t", i);  // print condition
      a[i++] = 0; // store 0 in a[i] then i = i + 1
      printf("a[%d] = %d\n", i, a[i]); // print i then a[i]
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:arrayTest1
  #+begin_example
  0 < N a[1] = 0
  1 < N a[2] = -1075053569
  2 < N a[3] = 0
  3 < N a[4] = -1962144679
  4 < N a[5] = 32765
  5 < N a[6] = 100
  6 < N a[7] = 0
  7 < N a[8] = 4096
  8 < N a[9] = 0
  9 < N a[10] = 220890880
  #+end_example

- *Explanation 1:*
  #+begin_quote
  In [[pgm:arrayTest1]], the condition test is printed alright, because ~i~
  has not been incremented. But after the assignment, ~a[i]~ is the next
  index that has not been assigned a 0 yet, so all values are random.
  When we print ~a[1]~ for example, it has not been assigned to ~0~
  yet. ~a[10]~ is not declared or assigned a value at all, because ~a[N]~
  has the elements ~{a[0] ... a[N-1]}~.

  #+end_quote

- What'd happen if the assignment were with ~a[++i]~ instead of ~a[++i]~?
  #+name: pgm:arrayTest2
  #+begin_src C :flags
    #define N 10
    int i = 0, a[N]; int j;
    while ( i < N ) {
      printf("%d < N\t", i);  // print condition
      j = i;  // support variable
      a[++i] = 0; // store 0 in a[i] then i = i + 1
      printf("a[%d] = %d\n", j, a[j]); // print i then a[i]
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:arrayTest2

  On Windows, you'd get this answer:
  #+begin_example
  0 < N a[0] = 66110
  1 < N a[1] = 0
  2 < N a[2] = 0
  3 < N a[3] = 0
  4 < N a[4] = 0
  5 < N a[5] = 0
  6 < N a[6] = 0
  7 < N a[7] = 0
  8 < N a[8] = 0
  9 < N a[0] = 66110
  #+end_example

- *Explanation 2:*
  #+begin_quote
  ~a[++i]~ would not be right, because ~0~ would be assigned to ~a[0]
  during the first loop iteration - remember that ~++i~ increments ~i~
  first and then stores the result in ~i~. The last iteration tries to
  assign 0 to ~a[11]~ which is undeclared. You can test that by
  initializing ~int i = -1~ at the start. Same problem at the end, for
  ~i=9~, the computer tries to initialize ~a[10]~, which is not declared -
  "stack smashing" means that the computer tries to write beyond its
  defined boundaries.
  #+end_quote

** Copying arrays into one another

- Be careful when an array subscript has a side effect. Example: the
  following loop to copy all elements of ~foo~ into ~bar~ may not work
  properly:
  #+name: copy1
  #+begin_example C
    i = 0;
    while (i < N)
      a[i] = b[i++];
  #+end_example

- The statement in the loop accesses the value of ~i~ and modifies
  ~i~. This causes undefined behavior. To do it right, use this code:
  #+name: copy2
  #+begin_example C
  for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
      a[i] = b[i];
  #+end_example

- This is one example where the =while= loop is not the same as the =for=
  loop.

** Weird ~for~ loop

- This innocent-looking ~for~ statement can cause an infinite loop:
  #+name: ex:infArray
  #+begin_example C
  int a[10], i;

  for ( i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    a[i] = 0;
#+end_example

- Explanation:* when ~i~ reaches ~10~, the program stores ~0~ in ~a[10]~. But
  ~a[10]~ does not exist (the array ends with ~a[9]~), so ~0~ goes into
  memory immediately after ~a[9]~. If the variable ~i~ happens to follow
  ~a[9]~ in memory, then ~i~ will be reset to ~0~, causing the loop to start
  over!

- Let's smash the stack!
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10], i;

    for ( i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
      a[i] = 0;
  #+end_src

* Iterating over arrays

- ~for~ loops are made for arrays. Here are a few examples. Can you
  see what each of them does?
  #+name: ex:for_array_1
  #+begin_example C
    for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
      a[i] = 0;
  #+end_example
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer 1:* ~0~ is assigned to ~a[0]~ through ~a[9]~.
  #+end_quote
  #+name: ex:for_array_2
  #+begin_example C
    for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
      scanf("%d", &a[i]);
  #+end_example
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer 2:* external integer input is assigned to ~a[0]~ through ~a[9]~.
  #+end_quote
  #+name: ex:for_array_3
  #+begin_example C
    for (i = 0; i < 10 ; i++ )
      sum += a[i];
  #+end_example
  #+begin_quote
  *Answer 3:* The values ~a[0]~ through ~a[9]~ are summed up: ~sum = sum +
  a[i=1] = sum + a[i=1] + a[i=0] ...~
  #+end_quote

* Let's practice!

- Let's practice: download [[https://tinyurl.com/cpp-array-practice][tinyurl.com/cpp-array-practice]] as array.org

- The first two problems can be solved with what you've already heard
  (one-dimensional arrays).

* Multi-dimensional arrays

- An array may have any number of dimensions.

- Example: the following array declares a 5 x 9 matrix of 5 rows and
  9 columns.
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int m[5][9]; // This goes from m[0][0] to m[4][8]
  #+end_src
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+name: matrix
  #+caption: Matrix indexes in a 2-dim C array (Source: King)
  [[../img/matrix.png]]

- In your practice file, declare a 2 x 2 matrix named ~foo~ of floating
  point values.

- Initialize the matrix with zero values as you would initialize an
  one-dimensional array.

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C  :noweb yes
    // Declare a 4 x 4 matrix
    float foo[2][2] = {0.f};
    <<2x2>>
  #+end_src

* Accessing arrays

- To access the element in row ~i~ and column ~j~, we must write ~m[i][j]~.

- To access row ~i~ of ~m~, we write ~m[i]~

- The expression ~m[i,j]~ is the same as ~m[j]~ (don't use it)

- C stores arrays not in 2 dim but in row-major order:
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+name: matrix
  #+caption: Row-major memory storage in C (Source: King)
  [[../img/stored.png]]

- Multi-dimensional arrays play a lesser role in C than in many
  other programming languages because C has a more flexible way to
  store multi-dimensional data, namely /arrays of pointers/.

- Practice! In the 4x4 matrix below, what are the values of
  1. ~foo[0][0]~
     #+begin_quote
     0
     #+end_quote
  2. ~foo[1][3]~
     #+begin_quote
     7
     #+end_quote
  3. ~foo[2][1]~
     #+begin_quote
     9
     #+end_quote
  4. ~foo[4][4]~
     #+begin_quote
     Out of bounds!
     #+end_quote

  #+begin_src C
    int foo[4][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15};
    <<4x4>>
  #+end_src

- Let's check:
  #+begin_src C
    int foo[4][4] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15};
    <<[4x4]>>
  #+end_src

- Challenge: 


* Accessing arrays with nested ~for~ loops

- Nested ~for~ loops are ideal for processing multi-dimensional arrays.

- Practice! Declare a 2 x 2 array of floating-point values.

- This code initializes a 10x10 /identity/ matrix.
  1) Set the dimension of the matrix to N = 10
  2) Declare a ~double~ matrix named ~ident~
  3) Loop over rows with loopindex ~row~
  4) For each row, loop over columns with column index ~col~
  5) Set each diagonal element ~ident[row][col]~ to 1, all others to 0
  6) Print the resulting matrix
  #+name: identityMatrix
  #+begin_src C
    #define N 5

    double ident[N][N];   // matrix dimension is N * N
    int row, col;         // loop indices for row and column

    for (row = 0; row < N; row++)
      {
        for (col = 0; col < N; col++)
          {
            if (row == col) {
              ident[row][col] = 1.0;
            } else {
              ident[row][col] = 0.0;
            }
            printf("%g ", ident[row][col]);
          }
        printf("\n");
      }
  #+end_src

- By comparison, this is how easy it is to declare, create and print
  an identity matrix in a language that is built for math
  manipulation, R:
  #+begin_src R
    diag(5) #    diag
  #+end_src

- To initialize an array, you can use brackets as in the 1-dim case,
  but for each dimension, you need a new set of ~[ ]~.

- What happens in the next code block? What do you think the output
  looks like?
  #+name: initArray
  #+begin_src C
    int m[3][3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

    for (int i=0;i<3;i++) {
      for(int j=0;j<3;j++) {
        printf("%d ", m[i][j]);
      }
      printf("\n");
     }
  #+end_src

- By comparison, in R this looks like:
  #+begin_src R
    (matrix(1:9,3,byrow=TRUE))
  #+end_src

- How could you populate the matrix column-wise instead of row-wise?
  #+begin_quote Answer
  By swapping the indices in the print statement.
  #+end_quote

- Test it:
  #+begin_src C
    int m[3][3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};

    for (int i=0;i<3;i++) {
      for(int j=0;j<3;j++) {
        printf("%d ", m[j][i]);
      }
      printf("\n");
     }
  #+end_src

- In R, that's the default, so the command is even shorter:
  #+begin_src R
    (matrix(1:9,3))
  #+end_src

* The size of arrays

- The ~sizeof~ operator can determine the size of arrays (in bytes).

- If ~a~ is an array of ~10~ integers, then ~sizeof(a)~ is 40 provided
  each integer requires 4 bytes of storage.

- The block below declares and initializes an array of 10 elements and
  prints its size in bytes.
  #+name: sizeof
  #+begin_src C :tangle sizeof.c
    int a[100000] = {0};  // initialize all array elements with 0
    printf("%d", sizeof(a));
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sizeof
  : 400000

- You can use the operator also to measure the size of an array:
  dividing the array size by the element size gives you the length of
  the array:
  #+begin_src C
    int a[10] = {0};
    printf("%d", sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0])); // prints length of array a
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 10

- You can use this last fact to write a ~for~ loop that goes over the
  whole /length/ of an array - then the array does not have to be
  modified if its length changes (see practice file).

* Use ~sizeof~ to print a matrix

- If an array of ~N~ elements has length ~N * 4~ (one for every byte of
  length 4), what is the length of a matrix of size ~M x N~?
  #+name: sizeof1
  #+begin_src C
    int B[3][3] = {0};
    printf("%d", sizeof(B));
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sizeof1
  : 36

  #+begin_quote Answer
  It is the number of matrix elements (stored linearly) times the
  byte length. In the case of N = 4, M = 3 that is 4 * 3 * 4 = 48.
  #+end_quote

- Storing a matrix:
  #+name: 2x3matrix
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    #define M 4
    #define N 3
    int C[M][N] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12};
  #+end_src

- Can we use ~sizeof~ when looping over rows and columns?
  #+name: matrixLoop
  #+begin_src C :noweb yes
    <<2x3matrix>>
    for (int i = 0; i < M ; i++) {
      for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
        printf("%3d", C[i][j]);
      }
      printf("\n");
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: matrixLoop
  :  1  2  3
  :  4  5  6
  :  7  8  9
  : 10 11 12

- The length of the row vectors:
  #+begin_src C :noweb yes
    <<2x3matrix>>
    printf("%d\n", sizeof(C)); // size of matrix C
    printf("%d\n", sizeof(C)/sizeof(C[0][0])); // size of row
    printf("%d\n", sizeof(C)/sizeof(C[0][0])*M/N); // size of column
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 48
  : 12
  : 16

* Let's practice!

- [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cc/piHome/org/14_arrays_practice.org][The practice file is in GitHub.]] Remember to download the *raw*
  Org-mode file and open it in Emacs.

- The last two problems can be solved with what you've just heard
  (multi-dimensional arrays).

* Noweb chunks
#+name: 2x2
#+begin_src C :results silent
  for (int i=0;i<2;i++) {
