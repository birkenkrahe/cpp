* What is C?

- C is a programming language created in the early 1970s.
- It grew out of the development of the UNIX operating system
- In turn, UNIX grew out of a space travel game (Brock, 2019).

#+begin_quote
"Python alone does not make a career. In our “Jobs” ranking, it is SQL
that shines at No. 1. Ironically though, you’re very unlikely to get
a job as a pure SQL programmer. Instead, employers love, love, love,
seeing SQL skills in tandem with some other language such as Java or
C++." (Cass, 2023)

- Doom (early video game) and Wolfenstein 3D
- Git version control system
- C compilers (Clang, GCC/MinGW)
- Interpreted languages like Python
- Any software that crosses platforms easily (portable)
- Software for the Curiosity Mars rover and most space apps

   #+begin_notes
   1. Why did C survive, and why did it have such a long-lasting impact?
      - Expressiveness (natural to use), efficiency (fast, small),
        environment (Unix)
   2. What did it take to write the definitive book on C? (Popular and standardizing)
      - In 1977 there were many Unix systems and no authoritative document
      - Book included a crystal-clear reference manual
      - Find examples that might hang together
   3. What do you find powerful about examples?
      - It'll tell you how to do something
      - It'll help you do something similar but perhaps more ambitious
      - Many examples were picked for Unix' text processing problems: "read input, write output"
      - Find things that are representative of what people want to do (in core form)

* What is a programming language?

#+begin_quote
"A programming language is a /formal language/ comprising of a set of
/strings/ that produce various kinds of /machine code/
output. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and
are used in computer programming to implement algorithms." (Source:
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language][Wikipedia]])
#+end_quote

- *Formal* language?
- Set of *strings*?
- *Machine* code?
- *Algorithm*?

Fortunately, computer (and data) science isn't really a science at all!

(It's more of a craft like mining, knitting, or pottering.)

#+caption: [Scientific] fields arranged by "purity" (xkcd)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/1_purity.png]]

In the xkcd cartoon, computer (and data) science do not even figure,
because they're so interdisciplinary (the opposite of "pure"). Still,
there is a lot of "pure" mathematics, physics and even biology that
plays a role in computer science (and programming).

The most important parts of maths for computer science are...? That's
a good question for our new mildly demented friend, ChatGPT (GPT-3.5):
#+begin_ai
The most important parts of mathematics for computer science are...?

[AI]: The most important parts of mathematics for computer science include:

1. Discrete Mathematics: This branch of mathematics deals with objects
   that are finite or countable. It is essential for understanding
   logic, set theory, combinatorics, and graph theory, which form the
   foundation of computer science.

2. Logic: Logic is crucial for reasoning and problem-solving in
   computer science. It covers topics such as propositional logic,
   predicate logic, and formal proof techniques.

3. Probability and Statistics: Probability theory plays a significant
   role in analyzing uncertainty and randomness in algorithms and
   data. Statistics is essential for understanding data analysis,
   machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.

4. Calculus: Calculus is important for analyzing the behavior of
   algorithms, optimizing functions, and solving problems involving
   continuous quantities.

5. Linear Algebra: Linear algebra is used extensively in computer
   graphics, machine learning, data analysis, and many other areas of
   computer science. It provides tools to understand and manipulate
   vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.

6. Number Theory: Number theory is foundational to cryptography and
   data encryption techniques used in computer security.

These areas of mathematics provide a solid foundation for
understanding fundamental concepts and theoretical aspects of computer
science and form the basis for many algorithms, data structures, and
analysis techniques used in the field.

* Where does C come from?

#+caption: "K&R" (Kernighan/Ritchie, 1978)
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/1_kr.png]]

- By-product of the UNIX operating system 1969 [fn:3]
- Developed on DEC PDP-7 (computer with 8K words of main memory)
- Written originally in assembly language
- UNIX rewritten in C by 1973 for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11][DEC PDP-11]]
- Standardization of C, 1973-2018

#+begin_quote
*Challenge:* what does "8K words of main memory" mean? [fn:4]
#+end_quote

See also: [[https://youtu.be/G1-wse8nsxY][C Programming Language | Brian Kernighan & Lex Fridman]]
- Text processing problems were inherited from Unix
- Examples should be realistic, useful and representative
- If you're the first in anything, everybody else has to follow

* Standardization

#+caption: How standards proliferate (Source: xkcd)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/1_standards.png]]

Details: see [[https://blog.ansi.org/2018/11/c-language-standard-iso-iec-9899-2018-c18/#gref][ANSI]] (American National Standards Institute)
#+begin_notes
Sometimes, standardization goes awry. For example, Python 3 was not
"backwards compatible" with Python 2.7, R seems split in a "Tidyverse"
and a "base R" community.
#+end_notes

* How computers work

Well, at least this is one way of looking at it.

#+caption: Computer architecture (simplified)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/1_computer.png]]

The "hard disk" can also be a Solid State Drive (SSD) or some other
form of Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) - i.e. it doesn't disappear when
the power goes out.

* How programs are created and processed
** Simplified process

1) *WRITE* source code in an editor (NVM = harddisk)
2) *COMPILE* source code to machine code (RAM = memory)
3) *RUN* program (CPU = Central Processing Unit)
4) *DISPLAY* results (RAM = Memory)
5) *SAVE* result (NVM = harddisk)

** Complete process

Specifically for C and our compiler GCC, this process looks
technically like this:

#+caption: GCC compilation process (Source: Hock-Chuan, 2018).
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/1_gcc.png]]

* Strengths and weaknesses of C

| STRENGTH              | WEAKNESS                     |
|-----------------------+------------------------------|
| Efficiency            | Permissiveness (Error-prone) |
| Portability           | Terseness and Understanding  |
| Power                 | Large program maintenance    |
| Flexibility           |                              |
| Standard library      |                              |
| Integration with UNIX |                              |

- Efficiency: do a lot with little effort (small programs)
- Portability: it works everywhere, on anything
- "Power": you can do brain surgery with a pencil
- Flexbility: you can do the same thing in many different ways
- "Standard library": pre-defined functions/tasks; "stdio.h", a
  standard library for "I/O" (Input/output)
- Integration with UNIX (because UNIX is the motherlobe)

* What is the difference between C and C++?

C++ is a superset of C.

#+caption: C/C++ logos

| WHAT | C                      | C++                |
|------+------------------------+--------------------|
| TIME | Thompson/Ritchie 1970s | Stroustrup 1980s   |
| TYPE | Imperative procedural  | Object-oriented    |
| GOOD | System programming     | Games and graphics |
| USED | Internet of Things     | Flight Software    |

* Why are we not just learning C++?

- Object-orientation is a difficult paradigm (C++)
- System programming is pure power (C)
- C is simpler, smaller, and faster
- C has 35 keywords, C++ has 95

  - Linus Torvalds (2007): "[[http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/linus][C++ is a horrible language]]"[fn:8].

    Also, there's this:

    #+begin_quote
    "Languages are tools. Memorizing them no more makes you a computer
    scientist than studying hammers makes you a carpenter." -[[https://qr.ae/pGzZ9z][Neilsen]]
    #+end_quote

    - It's easy to pick up additional languages
    - Data structures and algorithms are key to understanding
    - First language could be anything[fn:9]

* Summary

1) The C programming language was created 50 years ago
2) C is small, simple, very fast, and close to the computer
3) Linux (and Android) are largely written in C
4) The object-oriented programming (OOP) language C++ contains C
5) System programming is a powerful skill set

* Footnotes

[fn:1]All sources are referenced at the end of the script, followed by
the footnotes, which do unfortunately not render as links [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc100/tree/main/history_of_c][on
GitHub]]. The book by King (2008) does not cover a few recent updates to
the ANSI standard for C, like C11, and the current standard C17. The
next major C standard revision (C23) is expected for 2023. Gustedt
(2019) is a good (but quite difficult) book on "modern C".

[fn:2]Since 2000, C is one of the top two languages in the TIOBE index
(based on searches), and one of the top three of the (more relevant)
IEEE ranking.

[fn:3]The motivation to create Unix, according to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)][Wikipedia]], was to
port Thompson's space travel video game to the PDP-7 mainframe
computer. So in a way we owe modern computing to gaming.

[fn:4]How many bits can be stored in memory of 8K words depends on the
bit length of a word (or byte). One byte holds 8 = 2^3 bits (binary
digits, or memory locations capable of storing 2 states). 8K byte
correspond to 8 * 2^10 = 8 * 1,024 = 8,192 bits. By comparison, the
main memory of my laptop is 16GB = 16 * 2^30 = 3.2E+31 bits. It
follows from these memory restrictions that UNIX (and C) had to be
designed to be very small, or space effective.

[fn:5]Answer: no. By 1966, there were already ca. 700 programming
languages (Chatley et al, 2019), today there are almost 9,000. C
descends from ALGOL60, other important languages are Lisp (functional
language), SIMULA (first OOP language), and PROLOG (logic language).

[fn:6]This is a joke based on someone mixing up c (speed of light
constant) and C (the programming language).

[fn:7]However, he is biased, since he is the creator of C++. The title
of the video is misleading: Stroustrup believes that every C program
should rather be a proper C++ program. However, he also concedes that
C++ is still too complex for many ("We have to clean it up").

[fn:8]Torvalds (who wrote the Linux kernel in C) argues here in favor
of writing his hugely successful version control program ~git~ in C
instead of C++. He highlights some of the strengths of C: efficient,
system-level, portable code.

[fn:9]My first real programming language was FORTRAN (specialized on
scientific computing), then C++. Recently, I picked up R (for data
science). In between I've sampled (not mastered) many others,
including: Python, Lisp, PROLOG, C, PHP, SQL, SQLite etc.
