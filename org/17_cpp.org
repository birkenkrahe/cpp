* README

- This script introduces the basics of C++ and compares C and C++.

- PDF version of this file available in GitHub.

- This section, including some sample code, is based on Stroustrup
  (2014) and Hansen (2013).

* History

- Both modern C and C++ descend from 1979's "classic" C.

- C++ is a superset of C: constructs that are both C and C++ have
  the same meaning (= semantics) in both languages.

- Notable exception: /character literal/ (the byte size of a
  character constant) in C and C++
  #+name: sizeofAinC
  #+begin_src C
    int s = sizeof('a');
    printf("%d\n", s);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sizeofAinC
  : 4

  #+name: sizeofAinC++
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :exports both
    using namespace std;
    int s = sizeof('a');
    cout << s;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sizeofAinC++
  : 1

- C++ employs stricter /data type/ checking: the language doesn't quite
  let you get away with as much.

* Sample program

- It all begins with ~Hello World~, of course. When you tangle this file
  as ~hello.cpp~ you need to use ~g++~ to compile it (part of GCC).
  #+begin_src C++ :tangle hello.cpp :exports both
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
      std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

- Org-mode requires the ~C++~ header option and ~.cpp~ file extension,
  otherwise everything is as usual:
  #+name: cpp
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream>
    std::cout << "Hello World!\n";
  #+end_src

- Similarities and the differences between C and C++[fn:1]:

  | C               | C++                  | Difference                 |
  |-----------------+----------------------+----------------------------|
  | ~stdio.h~         | ~iostream~             | Header file                |
  |                 | ~std_lib_facilities.h~ |                            |
  | ~printf("...\n);~ | ~cout << "...\n";~     |                            |

- Compilation: the tangled code can be compiled and run using ~g++~
  #+begin_example sh
  $ g++ -o hello.exe hello.cpp
  $ hello
  #+end_example

- ~g++~ is part of ~gcc~ which we've been using all along:
  #+begin_example sh
  ~/Documents/GitHub $ which g++
  c:/Program Files (x86)/mingw-w64/.../bin/g++.exe

  ~/Documents/GitHub $ which gcc
  c:/Program Files (x86)/mingw-w64/.../bin/gcc.exe
  #+end_example

- You can also see that our work with Emacs and Org-mode carries over
  100% to C++. No need to bother with complex development environments
  like VS Code (Microsoft) or IDEs like CodeBlocks - IMHO you'll NEVER
  get the time you invest in these back, and the technology changes
  all the time without you being able to do anything about or with it.

* Sample program: rectangle

- Here is the rectangle program in C++ - we'll look at the details
  below.
  #+begin_src C++ :results output
    // *****************************************************
    // Compute and print perimeter and area of a rectangle
    // Input: length and width of a rectangle
    // Output: perimeter and area of the rectangle
    // *****************************************************

    // Include input/output library
    #include <iostream>

    // Use standard namespace
    using namespace std;

    // Begin main program
    int main()
    {
      // Declare variables
      double length, width, area, perimeter;
      // Print program information
      cout << "Program to compute and print perimeter and "
           << "area of a rectangle." << endl << endl;
      // Set variable values for length and width
      length = 6.0;
      width = 4.0;
      // Compute perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
      perimeter = 2 * (length + width);
      // Compute area = length * width
      area = length * width; 
      // Print input and output values
      cout << "Length = " << length << endl;
      cout << "Width = " << width << endl;
      cout << "Perimeter = " << perimeter << endl;
      cout << "Area = " << area << endl;

      return 0;
    } // End main program
  #+end_src

* C++ features that are missing from C

| C++ features         | What to do in C                              |
|----------------------+----------------------------------------------|
| Classes              | use ~struct~ data structure instead            |
| Exceptions           | use error codes, return values               |
| Function overloading | give each function a distinctive name        |
| References           | use pointers                                 |
| ~bool~ data type       | use ~int~                                      |
| namespace            | manage scope of functions, variables, types  |
|                      | (useful for larger projects w/multiple libs)x |

* Variables

- Types of variables / data types
  #+name: tab:types
  | ~int~    | Short for integer; stores whole numbers                                                       |
  | ~char~   | Short for character; stores a single letter, digit, or symbol                                 |
  | ~bool~   | Short for Boolean; stores true or false                                                       |
  | ~float~  | Short for floating point number; stores numbers with fractional parts                         |
  | ~double~ | Short for double precision floating point number; stores bigger numbers with bigger fractions |

- Declaring and initializing variables
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results silent :exports both
    using namespace std;

    int myVariable = 1;
    double a = 2.2;
  #+end_src

* Constants

- Declaring a constant as a /literal/ (non-variable)
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;

    const float pi = 3.14;  // pi is the constant, 3.14 is the literal
    float radius = 5, area;

    area = radius * radius * pi;
    cout << area;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 78.5

- The good old =printf= works, too, of course:
  #+begin_src C++ :results output :exports both  :includes <iostream>
    const float pi = 3.14;  // pi is the constant, 3.14 is the literal
    float radius = 5, area;

    area = radius * radius * pi;

    printf("%g\n",area);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 78.5

* Assignments

- What do C and C++ do when we try to add an integer to a string?
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;

    int myValue = 4;
    int yourVal;
    string myString = "word";

    yourVal = myValue + myString;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

  Error output:
  #+begin_example
  error: no match for 'operator+'
  (operand types are 'int' and 'std::__cxx11::string'
  yourVal = myValue + myString
       ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~
  #+end_example

  And in C: no error - just a warning, and an output is generated:
  #+begin_src C :exports both :includes <stdio.h> :main yes
    int foo = 4;
    int bar;
    char myString = "word";

    bar = foo + myString;
    printf("%d\n", bar);
    printf("%d\n", myString);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 8
  : 4

* Output

- Output in C++ is done with the object ~cout~ ("console output"), which
  prints information to the screen.

- ~<<~ is the /insertion operator/

- ~endl~ (end line) is the equivalent of ~"\n"~

  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;

    int myVariable = 1;
    double a = 2.2;

    cout << myVariable << endl;
    cout << a;
  #+end_src

- You can pipeline console output:

  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std; int myVal = 1000;

    cout << "Go Scots! " << "You can do it!" << endl << myVal;
  #+end_src

  - You can still use ~\n~:
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std; int myVal = 1000;

    cout << "Go Scots!\nYou can do it!" << endl << myVal;
  #+end_src

- This makes formatting printout quite easy:
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;
    int myVal = 1000;

    cout << "Lyon" << endl;
    cout.width(16);
    cout << "College" << endl;
    cout << "****************" << endl;
    cout << "Freshmen/juniors" << endl;
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Lyon
  :          College
  : ****************
  : Freshmen/juniors

* Input

- Generating an input file
  #+begin_src bash
    echo "1000" > ../data/input
    cat ../data/input
  #+end_src

- To generate input, use the ~cin~ (pronounced 'see-in', "console
  input") object with the extraction operator ~>>~.

  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :cmdline < ../data/input  :exports both
    using namespace std;

    int x = 0;
    cout << "Please enter a value for x " << endl;

    cin >> x;   // this is equivalent scanf("%d", &x);

    cout << "You entered: " << x << endl;
  #+end_src

- "Exception handling": Checking failed input with ~cin.fail~. This
  time, no input was provided.
  #+begin_src C++ :includes <iostream> :results output :exports both
    using namespace std;

    int x = 0;

    cout << "Please enter a value for x " << endl;

    cin >> x;
    if (cin.fail())
      {
        cout << "That is not a valid input" << endl;
      }
  #+end_src

* Other differences:

There are slight differences in all areas we've covered:

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Stroustrup (2014) recommends ~std_lib_facilities.h~ instead. You
have to download this file from his site. The hello world program now
runs without having to specify where the ~cout~ function comes from. Yet
another variation declares ~std~ as a ~namespace~ which means we don't
have to explicitly declare it with every use of its functions.
