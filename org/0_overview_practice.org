* Practice: first "literate" C program! (30 min)

There's a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/pdf/first_org_print.pdf][PDF of this exercise]] on GitHub, and a [[https://youtu.be/zRgIaJzrbnY?si=PfK3CMPTa1DyC-yk][YouTube video]].

Let's set Emacs up, write and run a first "literate" c program! it is
very important that you enter everything *exactly as shown*. if you get
something wrong just go back one step. Contact me if you need me after
checking with your neighbor if he or she can help.

1) Open the command line terminal with ~cmd~ in the search field

2) At the prompt, type ~gcc --version~

3) Open https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/ in a browser

4) Navigate to the repository ~emacs~ in GitHub

5) Click on the file name ~.emacs~ to open it

6) Open the ~Raw~ version of this file (there's a button)

7) Right click to ~Save as~ and save file as ~emacs.txt~ in ~/Downloads~

8) Open a terminal by entering ~CMD~ in the Windows search bar

9) Pin the terminal to your taskbar to open it quickly next time!

10) At the prompt, enter ~DIR emacs.txt~ - you should see the file

11) At the prompt, enter ~emacs --version~

12) Enter ~emacs -nw -l emacs.txt~

13) Inside Emacs, enter ~CTRL + x CTRL + f~ to enter a new file.

14) At the prompt at the bottom of the screen, enter ~first.org~

15) Enter the following text (replace ~yourname~ with your own name):
    #+attr_latex: :width 400px
    [[../img/0_first.png]]

16) 'Run' the program by putting the cursor anywhere on the code block
    and typing ~CTRL-c CTRL-c~. You should see the result on the screen.

17) Save the file with ~CTRL + x CTRL + s~ 

18) 'Tangle' the code with ~CTRL + c CTRL + v t~ (or ~M-x
    org-babel-tangle~): Emacs reports ="Tangled 1 code block from first.org"=.
    #+attr_latex: :width 400px
    #+caption: What happens when you tangle or weave a literate program

19) Open a shell inside Emacs by entering ~ALT-x eshell~

20) At the =$= prompt, enter ~ls -l first*~ - you should see ~first.c~ listed

21) Display ~first.c~ by entering ~cat first.c~

22) Enter ~gcc first.c -o hello~ to compile the C program into an executable

23) Enter ~hello~ to run the executable. You should see the output.

24) Exit and close Emacs with ~CTRL-x CTRL-c~

25) Exit and close the shell by entering ~exit~ after the prompt

26) Save your file to a directory on your GDrive (you can do this with
    File Explorer, or directly in Emacs with the following commands
    (you don't have to worry about spaces etc. because you can
    auto-complete using the <TAB> key):
    #+begin_example elisp 
    C-x C-w                   ;; write file
    w:/My Drive/              ;; target directory
    C-x d w:/My Drive/        ;; open target directory
    s                         ;; sort to see recent files at top
    #+end_example
    You can also do it in the Emacs eshell that you used earlier to
    compile and run the file on the shell (auto-complete with <TAB>):
    #+begin_example bash 
    cp first.org w:/My\ Drive/      # copy file to target directory
    cat w:/My\ Drive/first.org      # view copy of file at target location
    #+end_example
    
27) Upload ~first.org~ as your first in-class assignment:
    1. Open a browser to GDrive and upload the file
    2. Open the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/22790][assignment in Canvas]] at lyon.instructure.com
    3. Upload the file from GDrive (click on "~More~")
    4. When you see it attached, click on ~Submit Assignment~.
