[fn:3]I found this in a [[http://www.mit.edu/~bhdavis/TeachFuture.html][1994 article from MIT]], "The Teacher of the
Future" by [[http://www.mit.edu/~bhdavis/Index.html][Ben Howell Davis]]: »The teacher of the future is a teacher
fully engaged along lines of excellence [quoting what JFK said about
'happiness']. The only way to be happy in the information age with its
constantly changing technologies and information overload is to be
fully engaged in an active understanding of the problem. To be
interested in making sense of new and difficult time will require a
measure of involvement in new technologies and a measure of
involvement in providing a context for them.«

[fn:2] (1) Look through the material on GitHub ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc/tree/piHome/org][Markdown]] or [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cc/tree/piHome/pdf][PDF]]). (2)
Check the review of questions at the start of each session. (3) After
each class room session: write down what you didn't understand and ask
me after class or before the next class (or send me an email).

[fn:1]"The Dunning-Kruger effect was first discovered and written
about in 1999, by researchers David Dunning and Justin Kruger at
Cornell University. The researchers spotted how much people
overestimated their own abilities in daily life—think of the guy in
class who keeps raising his hand to relay his useless ideas—and coined
the term “dual burden”. Dual burden was used to describe that these
people suffer from two things: ignorance, and ignorance of their own
ignorance. The researchers tested random participants on tests of
humour, grammar, and logical reasoning. They found that people who
ranked in the bottom 25% of any of these test scores tended to predict
themselves to be at the top of the pack. When they scored in the 12th
percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. On the flip
side, people in the top 25% predicted their scores to be slightly
lower than they actually were." (Source: [[https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect][thedecisionlab.com]])
