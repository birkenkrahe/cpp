#+end_quote

Yeah, right. In your dreams. I saw the blank stares of (almost)
everyone else. The truth: you weren't supposed to understand
anything - the learning doesn't happen when I'm talking but when
you're typing - when you're doing stuff either alongside me in class,
or (better) on your own.

** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/MDPI_2023_BIRKENKRAHE_poster.pptx.png]]

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** Emacs tutorial
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 600px:
[[../img/emacs_learning_curve.jpg]]

- We're going to use Emacs to make our C programming life easier.

- But before it gets easier, it gets a little harder.

- This tutorial is meant to teach you Emacs as a text editor:
  [[http://tinyurl.com/EmacsTutorial][tinyurl.com/EmacsTutorial]]

- Open it in GitHub and then let's do it together.

- You will have to finish it on your own and submit the result.

- There are two videos by me covering the tutorial in 1 hour, and a
  bonus video with an advanced tutorial by Derek Banas ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNyiUAM_PFME-IiNGvNIOficR][YouTube]]).

** Emacs and gcc home installation
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/emacs_gcc_installation.png]]

Some of you've got problems installing Emacs/gcc. Emacs should work
out of the box [[https://mirror.fcix.net/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-27/emacs-27.2-x86_64-installer.exe][from this link]] - you only need to add the =bin/=
directory to the =PATH=, and for gcc, if MSYS2 is too complex for you,
just [[https://www.codeblocks.org/][download Code::Blocks]] - that's an IDE that comes with gcc and
then you have it in the =PATH=. If you cannot make time to meet during
office hours and are in despair, you can hop on a Zoom call with
me. Or you can ask one of those who seem to have succeeded: @Cristian
Del Gobbo @Austin Swaim @Karley Wilson all did this at home, I
believe. I promise: By the end of the week, you'll have forgotten the
nightmare and will be ready for more!

** Hello world - again and again and again

** Review: variables, assignment, print formatting, Emacs (chat)

Check your understanding before or after class. Here are 11 questions
on stuff of last week. Some of these may return in a test.

- [ ] What must each variable in C have to specify the data it can hold?
  #+begin_notes
  A type, e.g. =int= or =float= or =char=, so that the memory can be reserved.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can multiple variables of the same type be declared in C?
  #+begin_notes
  They can be declared together in one line separated by commas.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What must happen to variable type declarations in relation to
  statements that use the variables?
  #+begin_notes
  The variable type declarations must precede statements that use the
  variables.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What does the code block "int height; height = 8;" do?
  #+begin_notes
  Declares an integer variable named height and assigns it the value 8
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How is a floating point value indicated when assigned to a =float=
  variable in C?
  #+begin_notes
  By including a decimal point and the letter f, e.g. ~profit = 200.f;~
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is unsafe about assigning a =float= to an =int= variable directly?
  #+begin_notes
  Because it can lead to loss of precision, and the compiler won't warn you.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is the purpose of the =%d= format specifier in C?
  #+begin_notes
  To print an integer value.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is the minimal =printf= statement to print the number ~1~ as an integer?
  #+begin_src C :results output :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
    printf("%d",1); // printing 1 as an integer with %d formatter
    printf("\n");
    printf("%s","1"); // printing "1" as a string with %s formatter
    printf("\n");
    puts("1"); // printing "1" as a string with the puts() function
  #+end_src
- [ ] What do three dots =...= at the end of a line in Emacs Org-mode
  usually mean?
  #+begin_notes
  If on a headline, bullet point or code block header, the section,
  bullet item, or code block will open and close with TAB (toggle).
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can you run an Emacs Org-mode code block?
  #+begin_notes
  With ~C-c C-c~ (CTRL + c CTRL +c)
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can you copy, cut and paste in Emacs?
  #+begin_notes
  You can either use the preset keybindings to copy (~M-w~), cut (~C-w~),
  and paste (~C-y~), or you can switch to CUA-mode with (~M-x cua-mode~)
  and use Windows keybindings to copy (~C-c~), cut (~C-x~), and paste
  (~C-v~). In either case, you have to mark a region to work on (~C-SPC~).

** DONE Fast Fun Review: =printf=

1) What's the general format of the =printf= function?
   #+begin_example C
     printf ( {String} , {Variables} ) ; // String with format specifiers
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     int i = 3;
     //printf("I've got %d", i, "dogs\n");
     printf("I've got %d", i); printf(" dogs\n");
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : I've got 3 dogs

2) What's the general format of the format specifier?
   #+begin_example C
     printf ( " %m.pX ", {Variable} );
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C
     printf ("....|....|....|\n");
     printf ("%-10.5d.\n", 10 ); // integer, 10 fields left, precision 5
     printf (".%10.5f ", 10. ); // float, 10 fields right, precision 5
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : ....|....|....|
   : 00010     .
   : .  10.00000

3) How can you display ~10,000~ in scientific format (E-notation)?
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %e\n", 10000); // warning! 0 output
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %e\n", 10000.f); // precision issue
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %.e\n", 10000.f); // picture perfect!
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10,000 in E-notation: 0.000000e+00
   : 10,000 in E-notation: 1.000000e+04
   : 10,000 in E-notation: 1e+04

4) What's the specialty of the =%g= format specifier?
   #+begin_quote
   - =%g= handles floating-point numbers
   - =%g= automatically selects =%d= or =%f=
   - the case affects the symbol used (=%G= leads to ~E)~
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000); // %g needs a floating-point number
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000.); // %g picks integer format
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000000.); // %g picks floating-point format
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : Integer: 0
   : Integer: 1000
   : Integer: 1e+06

5) How many numbers can you print in one single =printf= statement?
   #+begin_quote
   As many as you like.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("%d\n%f-%.3f\n%g\n%.2e\n%G\n(etc.)\n",
            100,10.,100.,1000.,1000.,1000000.);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 100
   : 10.000000-100.000
   : 1000
   : 1.00e+03
   : 1E+06
   : (etc.)

** DONE Fast Fun Review: =scanf=

1) What is the general format of the =scanf= argument if the input is just numbers?
   #+begin_example C
     scanf( "{format specifiers}", {reference variables} );
   #+end_example
   #+begin_example
     scanf("%d%f", &i, &x);  // i is integer, x is floating-point variable
   #+end_example
2) What if the input has another form? E.g. a phone number: (870) 307-754
   #+begin_src bash
     echo "(870) 307-7254" > input   # create a file called `input`
     cat input  # checks content of file
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : (870) 307-7254

   #+begin_src C :cmdline < input
     int i,j,k;  // declare variables
     scanf("(%d)%d-%d", &i, &j, &k);  // scan exactly in input format
     printf("%d/%d/%d\n", i, j, k);   // print in any format you like
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 870/307/7254
3) How can you get input into a code block?
   #+begin_quote
   With the header argument `cmdline` and the input file `input`:

   #+begin_src C :cmdline < input
   #+end_quote
4) How can you create an input file with numbers from a code block?
   #+begin_quote
   To insert numbers into a file ~input~, enter in a =bash= block:

   #+begin_src bash
     =echo= "1 2 3" > ~input~  # redirect intput into file `input`
   #+end_src
   #+end_quote
5) What do these commands mean: ~ls -l~ and ~cat~ and where do they
   come from?
   #+begin_quote
   They are Linux shell commands that manipulate the file system:
   - ~ls -l~ prints a long listing of all files in the current directory
   - ~echo~ prints anything that follows to the screen
   - ~echo [stuff] > file~ writes `[stuff]` to ~file~
   #+end_quote
6) How can you open a =bash= shell inside Emacs?
   #+begin_quote
   With ~M-x eshell~ - the Emacs shell simulates a Linux shell.
   #+end_quote
   Alternatively, create a `bash` code block:
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     ls -l
   #+end_src

** TODO How does =scanf= work?

1) If the format string for =scanf= is ="%d/%d"=, what input is expected?
   #+begin_quote
   - Two variable references, ~&i~ and ~&j~.
   - Input in the format ~i/j~.
   #+end_quote

2) If the format string for =scanf= is ="%d/%d"=, which of these two input
   versions works and why: ~•5•/•96~ and ~•5/•96~ ?
   #+begin_src bash :results silent

   #+begin_quote
   ~•5•/•96~ - =scanf= reads ~5~ and expects ~/~ immediately but it gets a
   white space instead. It aborts, and never overwrites ~j~.

   ~•5/•96~ - =scanf= reads ~5~ and ~/~ then ~96~ as expected (any number of
   whitespaces after the ~/~ are ignored, and finishes.

- [X] Test 4 available / assignments / grading
- [X] Review: =scanf= (bonus exercise in class)
- [X] Code along lecture: C operators

** Test 4 available (deadline Tuesday!)/assignments/grading

/[This was an announcement on [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/discussion_topics/10013][Canvas]] and in the [[https://chat.google.com/room/AAAAIk8SqZE/WnkvTa3IkD0/WnkvTa3IkD0?cls=10][chat]]]/

- There's a new [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/22433][test available]] for you to complete by Tuesday 5th
  March. You've got 45 minutes for 15 questions, which should be
  plenty: take your time with it! I'll open the correct answers after
  the deadline.
- I have extended the deadline for the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/25363][`Mastering scanf]]` programming
  assignment to Friday, 8th March. See my remarks on submission below.
- The upload of the in-class [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/25543][scanf practice file]] is also due Friday
  8th March. There are new videos available in the course [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNyg7P7LCIpKxBun95Eb_PK4O][playlist]] on
  YouTube.
- Your grade does currently not reflect the bonuses. To do this will
  require some Canvas adjustments behind the scenes. I will do that on
  Wednesday by 12 pm.
- Quite a few of you got messages from me (check them!) to submit
  corrected files for full or for half points. Do it!

Org-mode Submissions: I wasn't too impressed with what most of you
submitted for the `[[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/25268][Mastering printf]]` assignment. Please check out my
sample solution file to see how it should've looked like: you can look
at the GitHub [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/assignments/mastering_printf_solution.org][Markdown version]], the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/pdf/Mastering%20printf%20in%20C%20-%20Sample%20Solution.pdf][PDF version]], or the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/main/org/assignments/mastering_printf_solution.org][Emacs Org-mode
version]] (with visible metadata). You can also look at any of the
practice files to see how it's done.

Here's the rub: coding as such is simple, these programs are almost
trivial. They're only a challenge to you (and to the AI) if you submit
yourself to the discipline of literate programming. This means taking
documentation, planning and reflection seriously and using Org-mode as
an interactive notebook. While in the world of Python and R everyone
does that, it's rare in the world of C and C++ (though this is where
it was born - the first literate program was an [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf][adventure game]] written
in C).

** A little practical review of =scanf=

1) Open Emacs

2) Create a new file ~scanf_review.org~

3) Add metadata at the top of your file:
   #+begin_example
   #+PROPERTY: header-args:C :tangle scanf.c :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
   #+end_example

4) Refresh local setup: run ~#+PROPERTY~ line with ~C-c C-c~

5) Create C code block with ~<s~

6) In the block, write the following code:
   1. ask to input an integer with =puts=
   2. scan an integer value ~i~
   3. print the scanned value

7) Tangle the code block to a source code file ~scanf.c~ with ~C-c C-v t~

8) Open an Emacs shell with ~M-x eshell~

9) Compile ~scanf.c~ into an executable file ~scanf~

10) Run ~scanf~ with the input ~100~.

#+begin_quote
You can upload a screenshot of your ~scanf_review.org~ and ~*eshell*~
buffers including the compilation, the execution and the result to
Canvas for bonus points.

- The result should look [[http://tinyurl.com/scanf-review][like this]] (screenshot).
- [[https://youtu.be/hGwIz5symtg][Here is a (silent) video]] showing the whole exercise.

** Review of test 4 - and an appeal to reason
#+attr_html: :width 700px:
[[../img/test_4.png]]

/Figure: Canvas report for test 4 (Mar 5, 11:30 pm)/

- You're still not using the available time: *45 min for 15* questions!
- Improve your mastery of C by *repeating* the tests until you have 100%.
- If your test scores could have been better, write the *final exam*.
- All final exam questions are *known* to you from the tests!

Let's go through the test questions!

Demo for one of the questions:
#+begin_src C
  printf("\"Hello there\" \n");
  printf("Hello there\    \n");
  printf("\\Hello there\\ \n");
  printf("Hello there    \n");
  printf("\"");
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "Hello there"
: Hello there
: \Hello there\
: Hello there
: "

** Remedial logic
*** What is an argument?

Let's watch Monty Python's "[[https://youtu.be/KwsGuZg9EP4?si=uTfoSjsx-YO9E149][Argument Clinic]]" for an example of what's
an argument and what's not.

- So what's an argument?
  #+begin_quote
  An argument is a sequence of *statements* aimed at demonstrating the
  *truth* of an *assertion*.
  #+end_quote
- Example:
  #+begin_quote
  "IF the bell rings, OR the flag drops, THEN the race is over."
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_example
           P          OR         Q       =>        R
  #+end_example
  #+begin_src C
    int P = 0; // 1: bell has rung, 0: bell has not rung
    int Q = 0; // 0: flag has dropped, 0: flag has not dropped
    if (P || Q) {  // check condition P OR Q
      printf("The race is over! (R = %d)\n", P||Q);
     } else {
      printf("The race is not over! (R = %d)\n", P||Q);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : The race is not over! (R = 0)

- Therefore:
  #+begin_quote
  "IF the race is NOT over, THEN the bell has NOT rung, and the flag has NOT dropped.
  #+end_quote
#+begin_example
              NOT R          =>         NOT P           AND           NOT Q
#+end_example
- Mathematical notation:
  $ P \vee Q \Rightarrow R$ and  $\not R \Rightarrow \not P \land \not Q $
- Another example
  #+attr_html: :width 400px:
  [[../img/argument2.png]]

*** What is a statement?
- Definition
  #+begin_quote
  A statement (or proposition) is a sentence that is true or false but
  not both.
  #+end_quote
- Examples: statement or not?
  #+begin_quote
  x + 2 = 4
  #+end_quote


#+begin_quote
2 + 2 = 4
#+end_quote
#+begin_quote
"I feel blue."
#+end_quote
#+begin_quote
"It is raining right now."
#+end_quote

[[../img/demorgan2.png]]

** Review: C operators

1) "You're the man": heuristic or algorithm or neither?
   #+begin_quote
   Neither - statement that could be part of an algorithm but only
   after quantifying "the man".
   #+end_quote
2) "Type twice CTRL + c": heuristic or algorithm or neither?
   #+begin_quote
   Algorithm - input instruction that a machine could carry out.
   #+end_quote
3) "To print a number, use the =print= function"
   #+begin_quote
   Heuristic - instruction that requires additional information
   (e.g. which language?)
   #+end_quote
4) Useful tools when designing an algorithm?
   #+begin_quote
   - Pseudocode (algorithm without syntax, includes input and output)
   - Visual modeling with diagrams (UML, BPMN, flow chart diagram)
   #+end_quote
5) Can you name at least one operator in each category?
   1) Arithmetic
   2) Conditional (Relational/Equality)
   3) Logical
   4) Assignment
   5) Increment/decrement
   #+begin_quote
   1) Arithmetic: =1+1=
   2) Conditional: =a==b=
   3) Logical: =a && b=
   4) Assignment: =i = 1=
   5) Increment/decrement: =++i=

- If you test code, use the graphical Emacs rather than ~-nw~

** Housekeeping

Alas, most of you need to resubmit your last assignments!

*** What are Org-mode metadata?

Org-mode metadata like: =#AUTHOR:= at the top of the file, or
=#+BEGIN_SRC C= at the start of a code block, or =#+PROPERTY:= are
interpreted by Emacs. Therefore:

- ~#+HONOR:~ is not a thing - metadata aren't arbitrary:

- Do write ~(pledged)~ next to your name in the ~#+AUTHOR:~ line

*** What's a literate program?

It's an Org-mode file that reads like a notebook, with: metadata,
process documentation, code, output, references etc.

It's not an arbitrary, unnecessarily complicated file format for
(uncommented) C source files.

Literate programs tangle into (compilable) source code and (printable)
documentation because programs should be for humans not machines.

*No documentation* in a literate program is not a thing: if you use
advanced concepts like arrays[fn:1], decaying pointers[fn:2], or
pointer arithmetic[fn:3]. I need to be reassured that you know what
you're doing (and not just the AI). You can only use advanced concepts
like these if you can explain them to me (and in your submission)!

If you forgot (or never knew) what I mean by "documentation", check
out my video "Your first literate C program with Emacs and Org-mode":
screenshot from 17'33'':
#+attr_html: :width 600px:
[[../img/litprog.png]]

*** What is ~//~?

Documentation is not source code: ~//~ is for inline comments in C or
C++ source code, and has no meaning in normal text.

*** What should you submit?

Do append your solutions as a *new section* ~* Solution~ to the problem
file. If you don't have a problem file, create one and put a short
version of the problem in there - for your own reference!

*** Once you've got 0 points on an assignment, is all lost?

No! You can *resubmit* after fixing your errors for full points. I will
not *remind* you individually anymore - just resubmit! If you did not
even submit in the first place, you can resubmit for 50% of the points.

*** If you have no idea what to do - should you give up?

If you're clueless how to solve a problem, *ask for hints*! To begin
with: There are *examples* for all assignments in the practice files.

*** Can you work on assignments together?

Working on assignments together is fine but make sure that you can
solve these simple problems on your own, too. Example phone
conversion: you can arrive at one solution, but then run and test your
personal submission with different phone numbers.

*** How will you know what the correct solution is?

You'll get my sample solutions after all is done. In fact, for past
problems, the solutions for past problems are already in GitHub (as
PDF files, so you still have to get the literate programs right).

** Review C operators

1) What are the basic Boolean operators in C?
   #+begin_example
    NOT  AND  OR
    \not     \land    \lor   (math)
    !     &&   ||  (C)
   #+end_example
2) What's a postfix operator in C?
   #+begin_quote
   Example: =i--= stands for i = i - 1
   #+end_quote
3) What's the difference between =++k= and =k++= if k = 2?
   #+begin_src C
     int k = 2;
     printf("%d\n",++k); // k = k + 1 then print k
     k = 2;
     printf("%d\n",k++); // print k then k = k + 1
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 2
4) In which order are =++k=, =k--= and =k+== executed?
   #+begin_src C
     int k = 2, l = 2, m = 2;
     printf("%d\n", ++k); // add 1 from left then print result
     printf("%d\n", l--); // evaluate from left (don't print result)
     printf("%d\n", m+=2); // add two from right: m = m + 2 then print
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 3
   : 2
   : 4
5) What is =!(!1)=?
   #+begin_src C
     if(!(!1)) {
       puts("!(!1) is TRUE");
      } else {
       puts("!(!1) is FALSE");
      }
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : !(!1) is TRUE
6) How can you check if ~NOT i~ is equal to ~j~ for ~i=10~ and ~j=0~?
   #+begin_src C
     int i=10, j=0;
     printf("%d\n", !i == j); // Check if NOT i is equal to j

     // i = 10 = TRUE => !i = !10 = !TRUE = FALSE
     // j = 0 = FALSE => i == j <=> FALSE == FALSE => TRUE = 1
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 1

** DONE Review: =while= summing a series of numbers

User enters a series of numbers and wants them summed up.

- Can you remember the pseudocode to solve this problem?
  #+begin_quote
  1. data
  2. input
  3. processing
  4. output
  #+end_quote
  #+begin_example
  // Algorithm: sum a series of integers
  Input: a sequence of integers ending with zero
  Output: the sum of the sequence of integers

  Begin:
     // declare and initialize variables `n` (integer) and `sum`

     // ask for and scan first integer

     // begin loop while scanned integer non-zero
        // add new integer to sum
        // scan integer
     // end loop

     // print result: the sum
  #+end_example

- Could you write the program?
  #+begin_quote

  2. =stdio.h=
  3. =main=
  4. =int=
  5. =puts=
  6. =scanf=
  7. =while=

    scanf("%ld",&n);
    // begin loop while scanned integer non-zero
    while ( n != 0 ) {
      // add new integer to sum

      scanf("%ld",&n);
     }    // end loop

    // print result: the sum
    printf("\nSum = %ld\n",sum);
  #+end_src

- Recall:
  #+begin_quote
  1. =while= tests a condition to enter the loop body.
  2. If the condition is false (=0=), the body is never entered.
  3. You have to modify the outcome to leave the body (or =break= out)
  #+end_quote

** TODO Review: counting with =while= and with =do= ... =while=

1) Open the practice file to the section "Limits and =top=".

2) Create a code block and (without peeking) write a =do= ... =while= loop
   for two variables ~i=10~ and ~count=0~: inside the loop, ~i~ should count
   down, and ~count~ should count up until ~i~ is zero. After the loop,
   print the final ~count~.

   Pseudocode:
   #+begin_example C
   // initialize i = 10 and count = 0
   do {
      increase i by one
      decrease count by one
      } check if i > 0
   // print count
   #+end_example

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 10, count = 0;
     do {
       i--;
       count++;
      } while (i > 0);
     printf("%d",count);
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : 10

3) Now run the loop for the three initial values (~count = 0~):

   1. ~i = 2147483647~

   2. ~i = 2147483648~

   3. ~i = 2147483649~

   Solution:
   #+begin_src C
     int i = 2147483647;
     int count = 0;
     do {
       i--;
       count++;
      } while (i > 0);
     printf("%d",count);
   #+end_src

4) How can you fix this?
   #+begin_quote
   Answer: change =int= to =long int= and =%d= to =%ld.=
   #+end_quote

5) A solution with our next two structures, =for= loops and arrays:
   #+begin_src C
     long int limit[] = {2147483647,2147483648,2147483649}; // array of 3 elements
     long int count[] = {0};  // empty array

     for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {   // `for` loop over array elements
       do {            
         limit[i]--;    // count down
         count[i]++;          // count up
       } while (limit[i] > 0);    // check if array element is non-zero
       printf("%ld ",count[i]);   // print final count
      }
   #+end_src

6) These loops take long enough that you can see how the CPUs are
   stressed with the =top= command (Linux only - in Windows, try
   =ctrl + shift + esc=).

Over the weekend, I'll publish a couple of easy loop exercises.

[fn:1]An "array" is a C data structure that can hold more than one
number or character, e.g. ~int phone[9]~ can hole 10 integers. Example:
#+begin_src C
  int phone[3]={870,424,5678};
  printf("(%d) %d-%d\n",phone[0],phone[1],phone[2]);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (870) 424-5678

[fn:2]In C, an array "decays" to a pointer to its first element.
E.g. ~phone~ is equivalent to ~&phone[0]~: both represent the address of
the first element in the ~phone[]~ array:
#+begin_src C
  int phone[3]={870,424,5678};
  printf("%p references %d\n",&phone[0], *phone);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0x7ffecb90ec4c references 870

[fn:3]When you perform "pointer arithmetic" you adjust the pointer by
that many elements of the type the pointer points to. Example: ~phone+2~
#+begin_src C
  int phone[3]={870,424,5678};

  // pointer values = addresses of phone[0] and phone[1]
  printf("%p %p\n", phone, phone + 1 );
  // dereferenced values of phone[0]1 and phone[1]
  printf("%d %d\n", *phone, *(phone + 1));
  // addresses = references to phone[0] and phone[1]
  printf("%p %p\n", &phone[0], &phone[1]);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 0x7ffe8741495c 0x7ffe87414960
: 870 424
: 0x7ffe8741495c 0x7ffe87414960
