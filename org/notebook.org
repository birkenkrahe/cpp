Yeah, right. In your dreams. I saw the blank stares of (almost)
everyone else. The truth: you weren't supposed to understand
anything - the learning doesn't happen when I'm talking but when
you're typing - when you're doing stuff either alongside me in class,
or (better) on your own.

** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

   - Learn to read error messages.
   - Finish the exercise: tangle, weave, run on CLI, upload to GDrive.
   - Upload it if you haven't done so already.
2. [ ] *Assignment*: Emacs tutorial ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/emacs/tutorial.md][tutorial.md]])
   - Start Tutorial in class.
   - Finish it at home.
   - Upload result to Canvas.
3. [ ] *Lecture*: C basics with "hello world" ([[file:3_hello.org][3_hello.org]])
4. [ ] *Practice*: C basics with "hello world" ([[file:3_hello_practice.org][3_hello_practice.org]])

* TODO Emacs tutorial
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 600px:
[[../img/emacs_learning_curve.jpg]]

- We're going to use Emacs to make our C programming life easier.

- But before it gets easier, it gets a little harder.

- This tutorial is meant to teach you Emacs as a text editor.

- Open it in GitHub and then let's do it together.

- You will have to finish it on your own and submit the result.

- There are two videos by me covering the tutorial in 1 hour, and a
  bonus video with an advanced tutorial by Derek Banas ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNyiUAM_PFME-IiNGvNIOficR][YouTube]]).


* Hello world - again and again and again
[[../img/helloworld.png]]

- Dissecting "hello world".

- See [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/3_hello.org][lecture]] and [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/main/org/3_hello_practice.org][practice]] file

- Upload practice file with Emacs (M-x eww):
  [[http://tinyurl.com/hello-practice][tinyurl.com/hello-practice]].

- Upload completed practice file to [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/23359][Canvas]].

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/24410][See Canvas for the complete assignment]].

- *When writing programs, the writing comes last.*

- *Planning* the program comes first. This includes:
  1. Understanding what exactly is required.
  2. Designing an algorithm in pseudocode for input/output.
  3. Making a process diagram to illustrate the flow.
  4. Coding in one or more languages.

- To illustrate this process see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/assignments/sample.org][this "Hello, World!" sample]].

- Steps 1-3 have already been done for you for the assignment.
