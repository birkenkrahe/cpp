* DONE Loops

- A *loop* is a statement whose job is to repeatedly execute over
  some other statement (the *loop body*).

- Every loop has a *controlling expression*.

- Each time the loop body is executed (an *iteration* of the loop),
  the controlling expression is evaluated.

- If the expression is *TRUE* (has a value that is non-zero), the loop
  continues to execute.

- C provides three iteration statements: ~while~, ~do~, and ~for~

* DONE The ~while~ statement
** Overview
- The ~while~ statement has the general form

  ~while ( /expression/ ) statement~

- The ~statement~ is executed as long as the ~expression~ is true.

** Simple example

- A simple example.
  #+name: double
  #+begin_example C
    while ( i < n ) {  /* controlling expression */
      i = i * 2;      /* loop body */
      }
  #+end_example

- Parentheses ~(...)~ around the /expression/ are mandatory

- Braces ~{ }~ are used for multi-line statements

- What does the code in [[double]] do?

- We can trace what happens [do this in the practice file]
  #+name: trace
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 1, n = 10;
    while ( i < n ) {
      i = i * 2;
      printf("%d < %d ?\n", i, n);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: trace
  : 2 < 10 ?
  : 4 < 10 ?
  : 8 < 10 ?
  : 16 < 10 ?

- What would the pseudocode look like?
  #+begin_example
  While i is smaller than n
    double the value of i
    show i and n
  end when i is greater than n
  #+end_example

- What would a BPMN model look like?

- Here, the task (C statement) is overloaded with a *loop*
  attribute. You cannot do this

  file from tinyurl.com/cc-while-loop, complete and run the code under
  the headline "Simple example".x

** Countdown example

- What does the following statement do? What is printed out at the very end?
  #+name: counting
  #+begin_src C :tangle counting.c
    int i = 10;  // declaration and definition
    while ( i > 0 ) {   // tests if i is positive
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);  // print i
      i--;  // same as i = i - 1; (executed from the right)
     }
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: counting
  #+begin_example
  T minus 10 and counting
  T minus 9 and counting
  T minus 8 and counting
  T minus 7 and counting
  T minus 6 and counting
  T minus 5 and counting
  T minus 4 and counting
  T minus 3 and counting
  T minus 2 and counting
  T minus 1 and counting
  i = 0
  #+end_example

- Why are we using ~i--~ and not ~--i~ ?[fn:1]

- What would change if we would swap the two statements inside the
  ~while~ loop?

- When would the ~while~ statements be bypassed completely?[fn:2]

- The code in [[counting]] could be made more concise (shortened by one
  line) - can you guess how?  Remember what you know about =printf=?
  #+name: concise_counting
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 10;
    while ( i > 0 ) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i--);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: concise_counting
  #+begin_example
  T minus 10 and counting
  T minus 9 and counting
  T minus 8 and counting
  T minus 7 and counting
  T minus 6 and counting
  T minus 5 and counting
  T minus 4 and counting
  T minus 3 and counting
  T minus 2 and counting
  T minus 1 and counting
  #+end_example

- Note that in the concise version [[concise_counting]], it makes a
  difference if we use ~i--~ or ~--i~. Try it!

- Your turn! Complete a simple practice exercise in the practice file,
  under the headline "Countdown example".

** Infinite loops

- If the controlling expression always has a non-zero value, the
  ~while~ statement will not terminate.

- For example in a game a loop would have a statement like ~while(1~) because
  this condition is always true - until the player enters 'quit`

- The compiler does not check this. The program [[inf]] has to be
  stopped manually (~C-c C-c~ in the e-shell, or ~C-c~ on the terminal).
  #+name: inf
  #+begin_src C :tangle inf.c
    while (1)
      puts("Still running...\n");
  #+end_src

- You can tangle the code block compile and run ~inf.c~ on the CMD line.

- Why don't you see any output in Emacs? [fn:3]

- To stop infinite loops from within, you need to provide ~break~,
  ~goto~ or ~return~ statements ("controlled jump").

- Your turn! Complete a simple practice exercise under "Infinite
  loops" in the practice file.

** Printing a table of squares
*** Problem

- Compute the squares of all integers from ~1~ to ~n~.

- Print ~n~ and its square as a table of ~n~ rows

- Sample output for ~n=10~.
  #+name: square_output
  #+begin_example
Enter number of rows:
         1         1
         2         4
         3         9
         4        16
         5        25
         6        36
         7        49
         8        64
         9        81
        10       100
  #+end_example

- You find this exercise prepared for you in the practice file.

*** Solution

- Generate test input file:

  #+name: square_input
  #+begin_src bash :results silent
    echo 10 > input
    cat input
  #+end_src

  #+name: square
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < input
    int i, n=10;

    printf("Enter number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); printf("%d\n", n);

    i = 1;
    while ( i <= n ) {
      printf("%10d%10d\n", i, i * i);
      i++;
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: square
  #+begin_example
  Enter number of rows: 10
           1         1
           2         4
           3         9
           4        16
           5        25
           6        36
           7        49
           8        64
           9        81
          10       100
  #+end_example

** Summing numbers
*** Problem

- Input a series of integers via the command line

- Compute the sum of the integers

- Sample output:

  #+begin_example
     Enter integers (0 to terminate). 8 23 71 5 0
     The sum is 107
  #+end_example

- You find this exercise prepared for you in the practice file.

*** Solution

- Scan numbers one after the other

- The program should exit when a ~0~ is scanned

- To sum, we can use the compound operator ~+=~

- Pseudocode:
  #+begin_example
  // Purpose: Sum a series of integers
  Input: series of integers
  Output: sum of all integers

  Begin:
     // declare and initialize variables
     // scan first integer

     while integer non-zero
       sum integer
       scan next integer

     print the sum
  End
  #+end_example

- Generate test input file:
  #+name: sum_input
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo 8 23 71 5 0 > ../data/sum_input
    cat ../data/sum_input
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sum_input
  : 8 23 71 5 0

- Code:
  #+name: sum
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/sum_input :tangle ../src/sum.c
    // declaration and definition
    int n, sum = 0;
    // get user input and first number
    puts("Enter integers (0 to terminate): ");
    scanf("%d", &n);  printf("%d ", n); // need non-0 number to start

    // test if number entered is non-zero
    while ( n != 0 ) {
      // sum = sum + n
      sum += n;
      scanf("%d", &n); printf("%d ", n);
     }

    printf("\nThe sum is %d\n", sum);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: sum
  : Enter integers (0 to terminate): 
  : 8 23 71 5 0 
  : The sum is 107

  - There are two identical calls to ~scanf~, because we need a non-zero
    number to enter the ~while~ loop in the first place.

* The =do= statement

- The =do= statement has the general form

  ~do /statement/ while ( /expression/ ) ;~

- It's like a =while= statement whose controlling expression is
  tested /after/ each execution of the loop body.

- When a =do= statement is executed, the loop body is executed first,
  (at least once), and then the controlling /expression/ is evaluated.

- If the value of the /expression/ is non-zero, the loop body is
  executed again and the expression is evaluated once more.

- Execution of the =do= statement terminates when the controlling
  /expression/ has the value ~0~ (/FALSE/) *after* the loop body has been
  executed (or if you abort the execution with =break=).

- Always use braces ~{...}~ around /all/ ~do~ statements, because otherwise
  it can be mistaken for a ~while~ statement.

** Calculating the number of digits in an integer

- ~do~ is handy for loops that must execute at least once.

- Let's write a program that calculates the number of digits in an
  integer entered by the user.

- Sample output:
  #+name: ex:dowhile
  #+begin_example
    Enter a nonnegative integer: 656
    The number has 3 digits(s).
  #+end_example

- Strategy ("algorithm"): /digits/ correspond to base 10 - if we divide
  the input by 10 repeatedly until it becomes 0 (via integer
  truncation), the number of divisions performed is the number of
  digits.

  #+begin_example
    656 / 10 => 65 (remainder 6/10)
    65  / 10 => 6  (remainder 5/10)
    6   / 10 => 0  (remainder 6/10)
   #+end_example

- Sample input:
  #+name: in:dowhile
  #+begin_src bash :results output
    echo 656 > ../data/dowhile
    cat ../data/dowhile
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: in:dowhile
  : 656

- Pseudocode:
  #+name: pseudo:dowhile
  #+begin_example C
  // Input: non-negative integer n
  // Output: number of digits of n
  do
    divide input n by 10
    add result to digits
  while n is greater than 0
  #+end_example

- Code:
  #+name: pgm:dowhile
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/dowhile
    int digits = 0; // number of digits
    int n;  // input

    printf("Enter a non-negative integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); printf("%d\n", n);

    do {
      n /= 10;  // same as 'overwrite n by itself divided by 10'
      digits++; // same as 'overwrite digits by itself + 1'
     } while ( n > 0 );  // test if n is still greater than 0

    printf("The number has %d digit(s).\n", digits);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:dowhile
  : Enter a non-negative integer: 656
  : The number has 3 digit(s).


- ~int~ is actually a so-called /signed integer/, a 32-bit datum that
  encodes integers in the range ~[-2147483647,2147483647]~. Any integer
  larger than this will not work - we have to use long integer types
  (=long int=) and a different conversion specifier (=%ld=).

** Counting down

Go to the practice workbook and rewrite [[counting]] using a ~do...while~
statement.

** Summing numbers

- Go to the practice workbook and rewrite the summing numbers program
  [[sum]] using ~do...while~.


* The ~for~ statement

- The ~for~ statement has the general form

  ~for ( /expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3/ ) /statement/ ;~

- Here, ~expr1~, ~expr2~ and ~expr3~ are expressions.

* Simple example: countdown

- You recognize the familiar countdown program - except that the
  ~for~ loop includes initialization, condition and counting down all
  in one go:
  #+name: for
  #+begin_src C
    int i;
    for ( i = 5; i > 0; i-- )  { // declare, discern and decrease
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: for
  : T minus 5 and counting
  : T minus 4 and counting
  : T minus 3 and counting
  : T minus 2 and counting
  : T minus 1 and counting

- *Practice that now!*

* Swapping ~for~ and ~while~

- ~for~ loops can be replaced by ~while~ loops and vice versa:
  #+begin_example C
  expr1;
  while (expr2) {
    statement
    expr3;
    }
  #+end_example
  Becomes:
  #+begin_example C
  for (expr1; expr2; expr3;) {
    statement
  }
  #+end_example

- Studying the equivalent ~while~ loop can yield important insights: you
  remember what happened when we swapped the postfix for a prefix
  operator in the ~while~ loop [[concise_counting]]. Rewriting this program
  as a ~for~ loop, we get:
#+begin_example C
  int i = 10;  /* expr1 */
  while ( i > 0 /* expr2 */) {
    printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i-- /* expr3 */ );
   }
#+end_example

- **Practice that now!**

* ~for~ statement patterns

- ~for~ loops are best when counting up or down

  | PATTERN / IDIOM             | CODE                         |
  |-----------------------------+------------------------------|
  | Counting up from ~0~ to ~n-1~   | ~for ( i = 0; i < n; i++ )~    |
  | Counting up from ~1~ to ~n~     | ~for ( i = 1; i <= n; i++ )~   |
  | Counting down from ~n-1~ to ~0~ | ~for ( i = n-1; i >= 0; i-- )~ |
  | Counting down from ~n~ to ~1~   | ~for ( i = n; i > 0; i-- )~    |

  - Counting up loops rely on ~<~ and ~<=~, while counting down loops
    rely on ~>~ and ~>=~ operators.

  - Note that the controlling expression does *not* use ~==~ but ~=~
    instead - we're not looking for Boolean/truth values but for
    beginning numerical values.

  - The following is cool (but also dangerous): you can initialize the
    counting variable inside the first expression:
    #+name: init
    #+begin_src C
      // int i;
      for ( int i = 3 ; i > 0 ; i--) {
        printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
       }
    #+end_src

* Omitting expressions

- Some ~for~ loops may not need all 3 expressions, though the
  separators ~;~ must all three be present

- If the *first* expression is omitted, no initialization is
  performed before the loop is executed:
  #+name: omit1
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 3;
    for ( ; i > 0 ; --i) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
     }
  #+end_src

- If the *third* expression is omitted, the loop body is responsible for
  ensuring that the value of the 2nd expression eventually becomes
  false so that the loop ends (just like in ~while~ and ~do while~):
  #+name: omit2
  #+begin_src C
    for (int i = 3 ; i > 0 ; ) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i--);
     }
  #+end_src

- If the *first* and *third* expressions are omitted, the resulting
  loop is nothing but a ~while~ statement in disguise:
  #+name: omit3
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 3;
    for ( ; i > 0 ; )
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i--);
  #+end_src

- The ~while~ version is clearer and to be preferred:
  #+name: omit4
  #+begin_src C
    int i = 10;
    while ( i > 0 ) {
      printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i--);
     }
  #+end_src

- If the *second* expression is missing, it defaults to a ~TRUE~ value
  so that the ~for~ loop will cause an infinite loop:
  #+name: omit5
  #+begin_src C :results silent :tangle forInf.c
    int i;
    //      for ( i=10 ; ; i-- ) {
    //         printf("T minus %d and counting\n", i);
    //      }
  #+end_src

- **Practice that now!**

* Printing a table of squares

- The program [[square]] can be improved by converting its ~while~ loop to a
  ~for~ loop:

  #+name: square1
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/square1_input
    int i, n;

    printf("This program prints a table of squares.\n");
    printf("Enter number of entries in table: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); printf("%d\n", n);

    for ( i = 1; i <= n; i++)
      printf("%10d%10d\n", i, i * i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: square1
  : This program prints a table of squares.
  : Enter number of entries in table: 5
  :          1         1
  :          2         4
  :          3         9
  :          4        16
  :          5        25

- Inputfile
  #+name: input:square
  #+begin_src bash
    echo "5" > ../data/square1_input
    cat ../data/square1_input
  #+end_src

- In [[square1]], all three expressions are controlled by the variable ~i~
  for initialization, testing, and updating. However, *there is no
  requirement that they be related in any way*: the version [[square2]] of
  the same program demonstrates this:
  #+name: square2
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/square1_input
    int i; // testing variable
    int n; // upper bound constant
    int odd; // incrementing variable
    int square; // initialization variable

    printf("This program prints a table of squares.\n");
    printf("Enter number of entries in table: ");
    scanf("%d", &n); printf("%d\n", n);

    i   = 1;
    odd = 3;
    puts("         i    square       odd");
    puts("------------------------------");

    for ( square = 1; i <= n; odd += 2) {
      printf("%10d%10d%10d\n", i, square, odd);
      ++i;
      square += odd;
     }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: square2
  : This program prints a table of squares.
  : Enter number of entries in table: 5
  :          i    square       odd
  : ------------------------------
  :          1         1         3
  :          2         4         5
  :          3         9         7
  :          4        16         9
  :          5        25        11

- The ~for~ statement in [[square2]] initializes one variable (~square~),
  tests another (~i~), and increments a third (~odd~).

  ~i~ is the number to be squared, ~square~ is the square of ~i~, and ~odd~ is
  the odd number that must be added to the current square to get the
  next square (without having to multiply anything).

* Exiting from a loop
** Overview

- Loops can have exit points before (~while~, ~for~) or after (~do~) the
  loop body.

- You can exit a loop (or any other statement) in the middle,
  too using: ~break~, ~continue~, and ~goto~, (and ~return~).

** The ~break~ statement
*** Overview

- Remember the use of ~break~ after a ~switch~ statement:

  #+begin_example C
    switch (...) {
      case 1:
        ...
        break;
      case 2:
      ...
    }
  #+end_example

- Likewise, ~break~ can be used to jump out of a ~while~, ~do~ or ~for~
  loop.

- Especially useful when breaking a loop as soon as a particular
  value is entered.

*** Example

- Let's create an input file. We want to break a loop as soon as the
  number ~0~ is reached.

  #+begin_src bash :results silent
    echo 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 > ../data/break_input
    cat ../data/break_input
  #+end_src

- Here's some code: what does it do? What would happen without the
  ~break~ statement? Would you know how to test that?

  #+name: pgm:break
  #+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/break_input :tangle ../src/breakInf.c
    int n;
    for (;;) {
      scanf("%d", &n);
      if (n == 0) break;
      printf("loop: n is %d\n", n);
     }
    printf("n is %d\n", n);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: pgm:break
  #+begin_example
  loop: n is 10
  loop: n is 9
  loop: n is 8
  loop: n is 7
  loop: n is 6
  loop: n is 5
  loop: n is 4
  loop: n is 3
  loop: n is 2
  loop: n is 1
  n is 0
  #+end_example

- A good way to check/record an algorithm: pseudo code!

  Here is the pseudo code for the program *with* ~break~:
  #+name: pseudoBreak
  #+begin_example C
    for ever
        scan an integer
        if integer is 0
           break for loop
        else
           print the integer
    print the integer (0)
  #+end_example

  Here is the pseudo code for the program *without* ~break~:
  #+name: pseudoBreak
  #+begin_example C
    for ever
        scan an integer
        if integer is 0
           print the integer
  #+end_example

- [ ] Let's tangle the code and run it with/without the ~break~ on the
  command line.

*** Practice

- *Important:* the ~break~ statement only breaks out of the *innermost* loop
  statement. If statements are nested, it can only escape *one* level of
  nesting.

- Example: The ~break~ only gets you out of the ~switch~ but not the ~while~
  statement.

  #+begin_example C
    while (...) {
      switch (...) {
         ...
         break;

- [ ] *Do-It-Yourself practice:*

  1) Open Emacs, create a file ~break.org~, put in the appropriate
     header, and construct an example demonstrating this behavior of
     ~break~.

  2) For the ~while~ loop, re-use the counting program, counting up
     to 3.

  3) For the ~switch ... case~ selection, label the cases 1,2,3 and
     print the label.

** The ~continue~ statement
*** Overview

- The ~continue~ statement does not exit from a loop. It brings you
  to a point just before the end of the loop body.

- With ~break~, control leaves the loop, with ~continue~, control
  remains inside the loop.

- ~continue~ is limited to loops, it does not work with ~switch~.

*** Example: summing up numbers.

The loop terminates when 10 non-zero numbers have been read. Whenever
the number ~0~ is read, ~continue~ is executed, the rest of the loop body
is skipped, but we're still inside the loop.

Input file:
#+begin_src bash
  echo 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 > ../data/continue
  cat ./src/continue
#+end_src

Pseudo code:
#+begin_example C
while n smaller than 10
  get input i           // scanf
  if input is 0 go on   // continue
  else add input to sum // sum += i
  increment n           // n++
print sum               // printf
#+end_example

Code:
#+begin_src C :cmdline < ../data/continue
  int n=0, sum = 0;
  int i;

  while ( n < 10 ) {
    scanf("%d", &i);
    if ( i == 0 )
      continue;
    sum += i;
    n++;
    /* continue jumps to here */
   }
  printf("sum is %d\n", sum);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: sum is 10


*** Practice: world without ~continue~

What if there was no ~continue~ available?

Download the practice file ~continue.org~ and change the program
accordingly, from: ~tinyurl.com/475m5x4n~

** The ~goto~ statement

- The ~goto~ statement can jump to /any/ statement in a function
  provided the function has a /label/.

- A /label/ is an identifier placed at the beginning of a statement
  (known to you from the ~switch...case~ selection statement):

  ~identifier : statement~

  A statement can have more than one label. The ~goto~ statement
  looks like this:

  ~goto identifier ;~

- Here is an example using ~goto~ to exit prematurely from a loop.

  The program looks for primt numbers.

  #+begin_src C
    int d, n = 3;
    for (d = 2; d < n; d++ )
      printf("%d\n", d);
    if (n % d == 0 )
      goto done;
    done:
    if (d < n)
      printf("%d is divisible by %d\n", n, d);
     else
       printf("%d is prime\n", n, d);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 2
  : 3 is prime

- Once, the use of ~goto~ was very common, but programs with ~goto~
  statements tend to be hard to debug.

- A good use for ~goto~ is during debugging, because you can jump ship
  when an exception occurs, and run a small test routine (designing a
  function to do this is an alternative).

* Extended example: balancing a checkbook

- Let's develop a program that maintains a checkbook balance.

- The program will offer the user a menu of choices:
  1) clear the account balance
  2) credit money to the account
  3) debit money from the account
  4) display the current balance
  5) exit the program

- These choices are represented by integers 0,1,2,3,4 resp. which are
  implemented as ~switch~ ~case~ labels.

- Here is a sample program session with the compile program ~checking~:
  #+name: ex:checkbook
  #+begin_example
    pi@raspberrypi:~$ ./checking
    --- ACME checkbook-balancing program ---
    Commands: 0=clear, 1=credit, 2=debit, 3=balance, 4=exit

    Enter command: 3
    Current balance: $0.00
    Enter command: 1
    Enter amount of credit: 100.00
    Enter command: 3
    Current balance: $100.00
    Enter command: 2
    Enter amount of debit: 50.00
    Enter command: 3
    Current balance: $50.00
    Enter command: 4
    pi@raspberrypi:~$
  #+end_example

  When the user enters the command ~4~ (exit), the program needs to exit
  from the ~switch~ statement /and/ the surrounding loop: the ~break~
  statement won't help, and we prefer not to use a ~goto~
  statement. Instead, the program executes a ~return~ statement, which
  will cause the ~main~ function to return to the operating system.

- Pseudo code:
  #+name: pseudoCheckbook
  #+begin_example C
  for ever until exit (4)
      Get input cmd (0...4)
      cmd = 0:
        clear balance
      cmd = 1:
        get credit amount
        credit amount to balance
      cmd = 2:
        get debit amount
        subtract amount from balance
      cmd = 3:
        print current balance
      cmd = 4:
        end program
  #+end_example

- Because the session interactivity is essential, we tangle the file
  ~checking.c~, compile and run it on the command line.
  #+name: pgm:checkbook
  #+begin_src C :tangle ../src/checking.c :comments none :cmdline < exit
    /* Balances a checkbook */
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
      int cmd; // user choice 0...4
      float balance = 0.0f, credit, debit;

      // User instructions
      printf("*** ACME checkbook-balancing program ***\n");
      printf("Commands: 0=clear, 1=credit, 2=debit, ");
      printf("3=balance, 4=exit\n\n");

      for(;;) {  // do this forever until exit=4
        printf("Enter command: ");
        scanf("%d", &cmd);
        switch (cmd) {
        case 0:            // clear balance
          balance = 0.0f;
          break;
        case 1:            // credit amount
          printf("Enter amount of credit: ");
          scanf("%f", &credit);
          balance += credit;
          break;
        case 2:            // debit amount
          printf("Enter amount of debit: ");
          scanf("%f", &debit);
          balance -= debit;
          break;
        case 3:          // print balance
          printf("Current balance: $%.2f\n", balance);
          break;
        case 4:
          return 0;
        default:
          printf("Commands: 0=clear, 1=credit, 2=debit, ");
          printf("3=balance, 4=exit\n\n");
          break;
        }
      }
    }

* Footnotes

[fn:1] ~i--~ is evaluated from the left, while ~--i~ is evaluated from the
right. Both stand for ~i = i - 1~ , but ~i--~ assigns the current value of
~i~ and then subtracts ~1~, while ~--i~ subtracts ~1~ and then assigns the
result to ~i~. In this case, the result is the same because we don't
have any more statements that use ~i~ but if there were, it would make a
difference.

[fn:2]The loop body will not be entered if the expression tests out as
false, i.e. if ~i~ is zero or negative.

[fn:3]Because the program never reaches the end, it never gets to
~return 0;~
