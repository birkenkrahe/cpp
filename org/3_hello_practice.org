* READ README

  - This file is a practice file for C fundamentals.

  - You will learn how to:
    1) understand and change syntax highlighting
    2) understand and use comments in C

  - Time: approx. 15-30 min.

  - When you're done with a section move the cursor on the section
    heading and type ~S-<right>~ (or SHIFT+<right-arrow>).

   - When you leave class without having completed the file, save a
    copy to GDrive as a backup and/or to work on it from home

  - When you've completed the file, upload it to Canvasx
    
* TODO Identify yourself

  1) replace ~[yourName]~ in the header of this file by your name
  2) add ~(pledged)~ next to your name (as in "I obey the honor code")
  3) Change the "TODO" in the headline to "DONE" (~S-<right>~)
  4) save the file (~C-x C-s~). 

* TODO Syntax highlighting

  1) Create a code block named ~pgm:hello~ with a program that prints
     "Hello, world!" on the screen: Use the ~<s~ template to create the
     code block.

     /Tip: the program itself consists of only one mandatory line!/

  2) Run the program in Emacs to make sure that it works (~C-c C-c~).

  3) Open the themes chooser with ~M-x custom-themes~. In the buffer,
     uncheck the current theme and check another. Then return here
     (~C-x b~) to see the effect on your hello world program.
 
  4) If you like a theme especially well, you save it for future
     sessions if you like by clicking on ~Save Theme Settings~. You get
     the message ~Custom theme saved for future sessions~ in the
     minibuffer.

  ----- Put code block here -----

* TODO Fix the program

  The program [[pgm:comment1]] below should print out the sentence "~I love
  my dog 'Milly'~". But it doesn't. Instead it prints:

  #+begin_example
   I dog 'Milly'
  #+end_example

  Something went wrong with the comments. Fix the program and run it
  again.

  #+name: pgm:comment1 
  #+begin_src C
    printf("I "); /****     
			 printf("love "); 
			 printf("my ");   ****/     
    printf("dog"); 
    printf(" 'Milly'"); //* I really do! */
  #+end_src

* TODO Comment program

   Write short comments in the program [[pgm:comment2]] to explain what each
   part of the program does (guess if you don't know for sure) -
   comment at least whenever you see ~WRITE COMMENT HERE~.

   The program contains so-called /inline/ comments ~//~ and /multi-line/
   comments: ~/* ... */.~

   #+name: pgm:comment2
   #+begin_src C
     #include <stdio.h> // WRITE COMMENT HERE

     int main (void) // WRITE COMMENT HERE
     {
       /* 
	 WRITE COMMENT HERE */
       int i = 1;

       // WRITE COMMENT HERE
       printf("%d\n", i);

       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src
