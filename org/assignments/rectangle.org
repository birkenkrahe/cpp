* README
1. Open Emacs and download ~rectangle.org~ from ~tinyurl.com/rectangleC~
   (use the Emacs browser EWW as you did in class multiple times, then
   write the file to ~rectangle.org~ with ~C-x C-w~, kill the ~*eww*~ buffer
   and open the file to complete the assignment).
2. Submit the completed Org-mode file here for grading and comments.
3. Here is a complete submission [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/assignments/sample.org][sample Org file]] using "hello, world".
4. You can resubmit as often as you like.
* Problem

Design an algorithm to find the perimeter and area of a
rectangle. You find the algorithm as pseudocode and as a diagram
already here. All you need to do is write and run the code inside the
already prepared code block and upload the complete Org-mode file.

The program should produce output like this (i.e. it should be clear
what the input and what the output is):
#+begin_example
If length = 5 and width = 7 then area = 35 and perimeter = 24.
#+end_example

* Pseudocode

The pseudocode algorithm abstracts away any syntax. It identifies
input and output variables.
#+begin_example
   Algorithm: Calculate rectangle area and perimeter
   Input: length, width (numbers)
   Output: area, perimeter (numbers)

   Begin
      // Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle
      perimeter = 2 * (length + width)

      // Calculate the area of the rectangle
      area = length * width

      // Return or print the perimeter and area
      return perimeter, area
  End
#+end_example

* Process 

The BPMN process diagram shows the program flow and explains the
communication between the computer and the peripherals (User input via
keyboard and screen output). [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/main/img/rectangle.svg][Open in browser]].

The UML diagram only shows the communication sequence - [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/img/rectangleSequence.png][open in browser]].

* Program

The code is written in an Emacs Org-mode block that allows to tangle
the source code into a C file ~rectangle.c~, but it can also be run
right here.

The code block should contain comments like the "Hello World" example
program ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/assignments/sample.org][link]]).
