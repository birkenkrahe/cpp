This is a sample Org-mode file demonstrating home assignment
submission in the format:
1. Problem definition
2. Pseudocode algorithm
3. Process diagram
4. Program code block

* PROBLEM (task)

Design an algorithm to write "Hello, World!" to the screen.

* Pseudocode (algorithm)

In this case, the algorithm is very simple - it consists of a single
print instruction. The pseudocode is a little overkill:
#+begin_example
Algorithm: Print hello world message on the screen
Input: none
Output: "Hello, World!" string literal

Begin
  // print string
End
#+end_example

* PROCESS (BPMN + UML)

The process diagram shows the program flow and explains the
communication between the computer and the peripherals (User input via
keyboard and screen output).

The UML sequence diagram shows the interaction only, as a sequence of
events between two actors:

You can make BPMN diagrams yourself at [[https://bpmn.io][bpmn.io]], and UML diagrams at
[[https://mermaid.live][nmermaid.live]].

* PROGRAM (C and C++)

The code is written in an Emacs Org-mode block that allows to tangle
the source code into a C file ~helloworld.c~ (with ~C-c C-v t~), but it
can also be run right here (with ~C-c C-c~).

The code block should contain comments like this "Hello World" example
program. You don't generally need lots of comments since your program
is literate and you have documentation! However, the file should
contain a minimal header saying what it does and who wrote it (and/or
where you got the source from).

#+begin_src C :tangle helloworld.c :results output
  /* Hello world program in C
     (C) Marcus Birkenkrahe */

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main()
  {
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, world!

Just for comparison, here is the same program in C++:
#+begin_src C++ :tangle helloworld.cpp :results output
  /* Hello world program in C++
     (C) Marcus Birkenkrahe */

  #include <iostream>

  int main()
  {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, world!
