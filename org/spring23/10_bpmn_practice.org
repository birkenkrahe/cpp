- This file is a practice file for BPMN process models

- Time: approx. 30-60 min.

- When you're done with a section move the cursor on the section
  heading and type ~S-<right>~ (or SHIFT+<right-arrow>).

* TODO Identify yourself

- replace the placeholder ~[yourName]~ in the header of this file by
  your name and save the file (~C-x C-s~).

* TODO Battle problem

Objective: learn to create, debug and save a process model.

1) Open the Signavio Process Manager at https://academic.signavio.com/

2) Create a simple BPMN based on the pseudocode [[pgm:pseudobattle]] for
   the battle problem. The model should look like figure [[fig:battle]].

   Pseudocode:
   #+name: pgm:pseudobattle
   #+begin_example C
     if health is less than 100
       Drink health potion
     else
       Resume battle
     end if
   #+end_example

   BPMN Model for the pseudocode [[pgm:pseudobattle]]:
   #+name: fig:battle
   #+attr_html: :width 500px
   #+caption: Health potion algorithm (battle problem) as BPMN diagram
   [[./battle.png]]

3) In the next models, change "Insufficient funds" to "Do not withdraw
   gold" (tasks need to be articulated as active).

4) Save the BPMN model.

5) Print the model as a PDF file.

6) Take a screenshot of the model as a PNG file (using the
   "screenshot" program from your Raspberry menu).

7) Save the screenshot of the model in the same location as the PDF
   file.

8) Check that the files are where you think they are using one of
   these ways:
   - Open a Dired buffer in Emacs (~C-x d~)
   - Open a Shell inside Emacs (~M-x shell~) and check with ~ls -l~
   - Open a terminal outside of Emacs and check with ~ls -l~

* TODO Gold withdrawal problem 1

1) Create a /model/ based on [[ex:pseudogold1]]:

   #+name: ex:pseudogold1
   #+begin_example C
   if action == deposit
      Deposit gold into account
   else
      Withdraw gold from account
   end if
   #+end_example

2) Save the BPMN model in Signavio.

3) Print the BPMN model as a PDF file (using the printer icon).

4) Open the PDF file and make a screenshot (PNG file) of the model.

5) Save the PNG file to the same location as the PDF file.

6) Add the PDF and the PNG files as *inline images* to this notebook
   using the code below:

   - PNG file as inline image: add a caption, and add the path to the
     PNG file: include the path in *TWO* square brackets (~[[...]]~) to
     turn it into a link. To view, toggle inline-image display with
     ~C-c C-x C-v~ (same as ~M-x org-toggle-inline-images~).

     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     #+name: fig:bpmn1
     #+caption: [add figure title] (PNG)
     [ path to PNG file, e.g. ~./file.png~ enclosed by ~[[~ ~]]~ ]

   - PDF file as inline image link: add a caption, and add the path to
     the PDF file: include the path in *TWO* square brackets (~[[...]]~)
     to turn it into a link. To view in another buffer, enter ~C-c C-o~
     (same as ~M-x org-open-at-point~)

     #+name: fig:bpmn2
     #+caption: [add figure title] (PDF)
     [ path to PDF file, e.g. ~./file.pdf~ enclosed by ~[[ ]]~ ]

* TODO Gold withdrawal problem 2

Create a model based on [[ex:pseudogold2]]:

#+name: pseudogold2_solution1
#+begin_example C
if action == deposit
   Deposit gold into account
else
     if balance < amount requested
        Insufficient funds
     else
        Withdraw gold from account
     end if
end if
#+end_example

2) Save the BPMN model in Signavio.

3) Print the BPMN model as a PDF file (using the printer icon).

4) Open the PDF file and make a screenshot (PNG file) of the model.

5) Save the PNG file to the same location as the PDF file.

6) Add the PDF and the PNG files as *inline images* to this notebook

* TODO Gold withdrawal problem 3

What changes if you use [[ex:pseudogold3]] instead? Make the changes.

#+name: ex:pseudogold3
#+begin_example C
  if action == deposit
     Deposit gold into account
  else
       if balance >= amount requested
          Withdraw gold from account
       else
          Insufficient funds
       end if
  end if
  #+end_example

2) Save the BPMN model in Signavio.

3) Print the BPMN model as a PDF file (using the printer icon).

4) Open the PDF file and make a screenshot (PNG file) of the model.

5) Save the PNG file to the same location as the PDF file.

6) Add the PDF and the PNG files as *inline images* to this notebook
