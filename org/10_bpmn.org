* README

- In this section of the course, we go beyond simple statements and
  turn to program flow and evaluation of logical conditions

- This section follows chapter 3 in Davenport/Vine (2015) and
  chapters 4 and 5 in King (2008)

- Practice workbooks, input files and PDF solution files in GitHub

* Process models

- Understand what a process manager (software) is and does
- Learn the basics of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)
- Learn how to create simple models in BPMN
- Apply modeling skills to creating pseudocode models
- Adding Pseudocode/BPMN models to future programming assignments will
  give you bonus points (5 extra points per assignment)

* Overview

- Flowcharts are popular among computing analysts and programmers

- Flowcharts are a special case of *process models*

- Process modeling is a key 21st century skill, because *process* is the
  central paradigm of modern work organization

- Rather than use flowcharts, we use BPMN - Business Process Model and
  Notation - see figure [[bpmnfig]] below for an overview of the whole
  language (you can get this poster at [[https://www.signavio.com/downloads/short-reads/free-bpmn-2-0-poster/][SAP Signavio]]).

* BPMN platform

We use ~bpmn.io~ for free process modeling.

* Points to remember

- Every model needs a pool = process owner
- Conditions become gateways
- Use active sentences for tasks
- When the flow is split, it must be rejoined
- All elements must be named
- Do not change the size of elements
- All elements can be "overloaded"

* BPMN elements

- Roles (pools, lanes, participants)
- Tasks (things to do)
- Events (status)
- Flow (between tasks or events)
- Gateways (decision points, condition check)
