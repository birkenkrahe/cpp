* README

- This script summarizes and adds to the treatment by King (2008),
  chapter 2, C Fundamentals - see also [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14qvh00aVb_R09_hrQY0EDEK_JLAkgZ0S/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102963037093118135110&rtpof=true&sd=true][slides (GDrive)]].

- There is an Org-mode file available for practice. Download
  ~3_hello_practice.org~ as a raw file from GitHub
  ([[https://tinyurl.com/y32yd3ax][tinyurl.com/y32yd3ax]])

- Open a command line terminal and change (~cd~) to the Downloads
  directory

- Open the file in Emacs with ~emacs -nw --file 3_hello_practice.org~

- When you leave class without having completed the file, save a
  copy to GDrive as a backup and/or to work on it from home

- When you've completed the file, upload it to Canvas where you'll
  find a "Class practice" assignment named ~3_hello_practice.org~.

* Program structure
#+attr_latex: :width 300px
#+caption: main function structure (Collingbourne, 2017)
[[../img/3_structure.png]]

- All C program statements must be included in a ~main~ function

- The ~main~ function has a body delimited by ~{...}~

- There can be /pre-processor/ /directives/ - ~#include~ or ~#define~.

- ~main()~ is similar to ~f(x)~ in mathematics - () means "no argument"

- ~printf()~ prints its argument: ~"hello world"~ which is a 'string'

- ~\n~ means "go to the next line" - 'escape character'

- ~;~ ends every command - the computer waits for the next one!

- The computer (aka compiler) ignores "white space"

* "What a Tangled Web We Weave..."

#+begin_quote
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!"
(Sir Walter Scott, 1808)
#+end_quote

In this section, we're once again running code blocks from within
Org-mode - with a few new /literate programming/ features:

- To distinguish (and reference) code blocks, we will name them
  (~#+NAME:~). The name can can then be referenced anywhere

- To turn the code block into a source code C file (~.c~), we will
  add a ~:tangle FILENAME~ statement to the header

- To create the tangled (source code) file from a block, use the keys
  ~C-c C-v t~ (~org-babel-tangle~) [fn:1]

- To create the tangled (source code) from a file (all blocks), use
  the keys ~C-c C-v f~ (~org-babel-tangle-file~)

- Since source code files should have comments, we add the header
  argument ~:comments both~: now, the most recent org block is used as a
  comment

- The workflow of "tangling" and "weaving"[fn:2] looks like this:
  #+attr_latex: :width 300px

  [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html][Learn more about extracting source code from Org files.]]

* Hello World Version 1 (medium)
#+NAME: hello1
#+begin_src C :exports both :tangle ../src/hello1.c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void)
  {
    printf("Hello world\n");
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

What happens in this code block:
- A /header/ file (~stdio.h~) is included for input/output
- A /function/ (~main~) without arguments (~void~) is defined
- The function returns /integer/ data (~int~)
- A /string/ (~"..."~) is printed out
- A /new-line/ is added at the end (~\n~)
- If successful, the program /returns/ the value ~0~

* Hello World Version 2 (short)

The program could also have been written much simpler:

- In this code block, the function ~main~ is missing the ~void~ argument,
  and the ~int~ (indicating the type of variable returned - an integer).
  #+NAME: hello2
  #+begin_src C :exports both :tangle hello.c :main no
    #include <stdio.h>
    main()
    {
      printf("Hello world\n");
    }
  #+end_src

- It is the job of the /compiler/, ~gcc~, which acts behind the scenes as
  it were, to resolve issues like "missing ~int~" or "missing ~return~"

- If you /tangle/ the code block and compile the source file ~hello2.c~ in
  a shell, you get a warning:
  #+begin_example sh
    $ gcc hello2.c
      hello2.c:2:1: warning: return type defaults to 'int' [-Wimplicit-int]
      main()
      ^~~~
  #+end_example
  
* Hello World Version 3 (long)

The program could also have been written more complicated:
- ~int argc~ is an integer, or single number - the number of arguments
  that were passed to ~main~
- ~char **argv~ (or ~char *argv[]~) is a /pointer/ that refers to an /array/
  of characters - a more complicated data structure

#+NAME: hello3
#+begin_src C :exports both :tangle ../src/hello3.c :comments both
  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
    printf("hello world\n");
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

* Compiler workflow

The machine cannot process a C source file like ~hello.c~ without
help. It must:
#+name: tab:compile1
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Preprocess/ | The preprocessor acts on lines beginning with ~#~             |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Compile/    | The compiler translates instructions into object code       |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Link/       | The linker combines object code and functions like ~printf()~ |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Run/        | The final ~*.exe~ program is a binary (machine) program       |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Debug/      | The debugger controls rule violations along the way         |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------------|

I compiled the ~hello.c~ program on a Linux box - the executable is
called ~hello.out~. The other binary is ~hello.exe~ compiled on
Windows. Compare the two executables - what do you notice?

[[../img/3_files.png]]

*Question: are these executables portable?*[fn:3]

* Shell execution

- You can also save the code in a C source code file ~hello.c~

- Instead of Emacs, you could use ~notepad~ on Windows or ~nano~ on Linux

- You can compile the source files on the command line terminal or in
  the Emacs shell. Here is the workflow:

#+name: tab:compile2
| COMMAND              | ACTION                                     |
|----------------------+--------------------------------------------|
| ~C-x C-f hello.c~      | Create C file ~hello.c~                      |
|                      | Copy block or write code anew in ~hello.c~   |
| ~C-x C-s~              | Save ~hello.c~                               |
| ~M-x eshell~           | start a Linux shell in an Emacs buffer     |
| ~gcc hello.c -o hello~ | compile program and create executable      |
| ~ls -l hello*~         | list files - you should see ~hello~, ~hello.c~ |
| ~./hello~              | execute program                            |

- The /eshell/ is an Emacs Lisp simulation of a Linux shell (~bash~)

- On Windows, ~PowerShell~ works as well as the CMD shell:

* Syntax highlighting in Emacs

- Notice the slight syntax highlighting difference to an online REPL
  ~repl.it~ [fn:4]:
  #+attr_latex: :width 200px
  [[../img/3_replit.png]]
  #+attr_latex: :width 200px
  [[../img/3_org.png]]

- There is no highlighting standard - you should experiment with
  different themes[fn:5].

- Display line numbers with ~display-line-numbers-mode~, and highlight
  lines with ~hl-line-mode~ - you can toggle these, and you can
  go through the minibuffer history with ~M-x M-p~ and ~M-n~:

  #+attr_latex: :width 200px
  [[../img/3_pun.png]]

* Comments

Forgetting to terminate a /comment/ may cause the compiler to ignore
part of your program - but both syntax highlighting and auto-indent
in the editor will tip you off:

#+begin_src C :exports both :main yes :includes stdio.h :results output

  printf("My "); /* forgot to close this comment ...
                    printf("cat ");
                    printf("has ");  /* so it ends here */
  printf("fleas");

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: My fleas

Let's fix this:

#+begin_src C :exports both :main yes :includes stdio.h

  printf("My "); /* forgot to close this comment */
  printf("cat ");
  printf("has no ");  /* so it ends here */
  printf("fleas");

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: My cat has no fleas

* Let's practice!

Save the [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/cc/piHome/org/2_hello_practice.org][practice file]] as ~1_hello_practice.org~ and complete it:

1) understand and change syntax highlighting
2) understanding and using comments in C

* Summary

- C programs must be compiled and linked
- Programs consist of directives, functions, and statements
- C directives begin with a hash mark (~#~)
- C statements end with a semicolon (~;~)
- C functions begin and end with parentheses ~{~ and ~}~
- C programs should be readable
- Input and output has to be formatted correctly

[fn:1] To tangle only the currently selected block, use
~org-babel-tangle~ with a prefix argument: ~C-u C-c C-v t~ or ~C-u M-x
org-bable-tangle~.

[fn:2] In our case, instead of weaving TeX files (~.tex~) to print, we
weave Markdown files (~.md~), or WORD (~*.odt~) files, or we dispense with
the weaving altogether because Org-mode files (equivalent of the ~*.w~
or "web" files) look fine on GitHub.  GitHub.

[fn:3] Executables are the result of compilation for a specific
computer architecture and OS. The ~.exe~ program was compiled for
Windows, the ~.out~ program was compiled for Linux. They will only run
on these OS.

[fn:4][[https://replit.com][replit.com]] is an online Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL) that looks
like a Linux installation (in fact, it is a so-called Docker
container, an emulated, customized Linux installation). When
registering (for free) you can use many different programming
languages - here is a [[https://replit.com/@birkenkrahe/DiscreteDearObjectdatabase#main.c][link to my container]].

[fn:5] You can find different [[https://emacsthemes.com/][themes for GNU Emacs]] here, and install
them using ~M-x package-list-packages~. To see the differences, enter
~M-x custom-themes~ and pick another theme now. You can save it
automatically for future sessions.
