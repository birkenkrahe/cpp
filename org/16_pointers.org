- This script introduces C pointers in theory and practice.

- This section, including some sample code, is based on: chapter 11
  in King (2008), and chapter 7 in Davenport/Vine.

* Overview

- Remember the fundamental architectural problem of the "von Neumann"
  architecture of digital computers.

- Imagine: CPU \equiv brain, Memory \equiv house, Harddisk \equiv moon
  #+begin_quote
  1. CPU and the Brain: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is like the
     brain because it is responsible for processing all instructions
     and making decisions. It performs the core computations and
     controls other parts of the computer based on the input it
     receives, similar to how the brain processes sensory information
     and dictates responses.
  2. RAM and a House: RAM (Random Access Memory) is akin to a house
     because it serves as the active, working area where tasks are
     carried out and information is temporarily held. Just as a house
     contains rooms where daily activities occur (e.g., sleeping,
     eating, working), RAM holds active applications and data for
     quick access by the CPU. The size of the RAM affects how much
     activity (or how many applications) can be handled at once, much
     like the size of a house determines how many activities can
     comfortably occur simultaneously.
  3. Hard Disk and the Moon: A hard disk is comparable to the Moon in
     that it serves as a distant but integral storage location. Just
     as the Moon orbits Earth and is a more remote body holding
     impacts of meteorites and historical footprints, a hard disk
     stores data that is not immediately needed for current processing
     tasks but is crucial for long-term storage. Its contents are not
     as quickly accessible as those in RAM, reflecting the Moon’s
     greater distance compared to our immediate environment.

- Computer memory is like a list of /locations/

- Each chunk of memory has an /address/ to a location

- /Pointers/ point to these addresses

- The /address/ is not the house, it's a /reference/ to the house:

- C#, Java, Python...do not offer pointers (easily) - most of the
  direct memory management is "abstracted" away (i.e. the memory is
  hidden and a simpler user interface is offered).
  #+begin_quote
  1. C#: C# does support pointers, but their use is limited to unsafe
     code blocks. You must explicitly mark these areas with the =unsafe=
     keyword. This feature allows you to perform operations that
     involve direct memory access, similar to C or C++. However, using
     pointers is generally discouraged in favor of safer constructs
     provided by the language, such as objects and reference types.
  2. Java: Java does not support pointers, at least not in the
     traditional sense as seen in C or C++. Instead, Java handles
     memory through references to objects, and these references are
     abstracted away from direct memory address manipulation. This
     abstraction is part of Java's design to ensure security and
     simplicity in memory management, reducing the likelihood of
     errors such as memory leaks or pointer arithmetic.
  3. Python: Python also does not use pointers. It handles everything
     by object references. The language is designed to abstract away
     most direct memory management tasks from the developer,
     automatically handling object creation and destruction through a
     built-in garbage collector. Python’s approach simplifies the
     development process but at the cost of direct control over memory
     and performance optimizations that pointers can offer.

- C and C++ offer pointer variables and operators naturally

- This gives you a lot more control over the computer (because every
  operation, every process involves memory management)

- Examples:
  - *String manipulation* (working with text - e.g. when creating
    fast-performing chat bots or AI agents.
    
  - *Dynamic memory allocation* - the process of assigning memory
    during the execution time (when a program typically competes
    with thousands of other processes).

- This is /mind control/: You can essentially decide what the computer
  should think with which part of its "brain" (great potential to
  mess up, too), e.g. when you mis-allocate resources.

* Indirection (concept)

- Open Emacs on a codealong file like [[https://tinyurl.com/cpp-practice-org][tinyurl.com/cpp-practice-org]] and
  save it (C-x C-s) as an Org-mode file ~pointers.org~ to code along.

- Imagine you have a /variable/ ~iResult~ that contains the /value/ ~75~.

- The variable is /located/ at a memory address, e.g. ~0061FEC8~.
  #+begin_src C
    int iResult = 75.;
    printf("%d is referenced by %p\n", iResult, &iResult);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 75 is referenced by 0x7fffcbf922f4

- You see that repeated executions of this code creates different
  addresses. A /pointer/ is a variable that holds an address.

- Imagine you have a /pointer variable/ ~myPointer~ that contains the
  address of the variable ~iResult~:
  #+begin_src C
    int iResult = 75.;
    printf("%d <- %p\n", iResult, &iResult);
    int *myPointer = &iResult;
    printf("%p -> %d\n",myPointer, iResult);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 75 <- 0x7fff03138c0c
  : 0x7fff03138c0c -> 75

- This means that ~myPointer~ /indirectly/ points to the value ~75~.

- You already worked with addresses: an /array name/ ~a~ is a pointer to
  the start of the array, the address of ~a[0]~.

- In the next code block, the conversion specifier ~%p~ lets us access
  the addresses that correspond to elements of the array ~a~, and even
  the address for the whole array.

- We declare an array ~a[2]~ and then we print its addresses:  
  #+name: ptrprint
  #+begin_src C
    int a[2] = {100,1000}; // define a 1-dim array of 2 elements
    printf("a[0] = %p\na[1] = %p\n&a   = %p\n", &a[0], &a[1], &a);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ptrprint
  : a[0] = 0x7ffe86d81e00
  : a[1] = 0x7ffe86d81e04
  : &a   = 0x7ffe86d81e00

- You can see that the address for ~a~ points to ~a[0].~

- You already worked with pointers: arguments in the call of ~scanf~
  are /pointers/: without the ~&~, the function would be supplied with
  the /value/ of ~i~, not the /address/. But ~scanf~'s job is to assign a
  memory location (an address) to the input variable.
  #+begin_example C
  int i;
  scanf("%d", &i);
  #+end_example

- The relationship between variable value and memory address is called
  /indirection: A /pointer/ provides /indirect/ access to the value via the
  address where the value is stored.

* Indirection (code)

- There are two /unary/ pointer operators:
  - the /address/ (or referencing) operator ~&~
  - the /indirection/ (or dereferencing) operator ~*~

- The unary /address/ operator ~&~ returns a computer memory address,
  e.g. ~&i = 0x7ffc7600b79c~ - it /references/ the memory location.

- What if ~i~ has not been initialized yet? Will the address change?
  Print the reference to ~i~ before initializing it, and after.
  #+begin_src C
    int i;
    printf("%p\n",&i);
    i = 100;
    printf("%p\n",&i);    
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x7ffd9b388cc4
  : 0x7ffd9b388cc4

- The unary /indirection/ operator ~*~ returns a value, e.g. ~*p = 75~ if ~p~
  points at a variable that contains the value ~75~.

- Let's do it all in one code block:
  1) declare an integer variable ~i~
  2) assign the value ~1~ to ~i~
  3) declare an integer pointer ~*p~
  4) assign the address of ~i~ to ~p~ 
  5) print ~i~ and ~&i~
  6) print ~p~ and ~*p~

  #+begin_src C
    // variables
    int i; // declare integer variable
    i = 1; // assign value to variable

    // pointers
    int *p; // declare integer pointer
    p = &i;

    // print variables
    printf("%d lives at %p\n",i,&i);
    
    // print pointers
    printf("%p points to %d\n",p,i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 1 lives at 0x7ffd9d703f7c
  : 0x7ffd9d703f7c points to 1

- What if you assign a number ~1~ to ~p~ instead of an address?
  #+begin_src C
    // variables
    int i; // declare integer variable
    i = 1; // assign value to variable

    // pointers
    int *p; // declare integer pointer
    p = 1; // warning: missing 'cast' 

    // print pointer value
    printf("%p\n",p); // '0x1' is a reserved memory address
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x1

- The figure illustrates these concepts. Can you describe what
  goes on from line to line?
  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  #+caption: Graphical illustration of the indirection operator (Source: King)
  [[../img/16_indirection.png]]

  #+begin_quote Answer
  1) The pointer ~p~ points to the address ~&i~ of the variable ~i~.
  2) ~i~ is initialized with the value ~1~. ~p~ still points at it.
  3) To change the value of ~i~ indirectly using the pointer ~p~, we
     assign ~*p = 2~. The indirection operator ~*~ designates a pointer.
  4) To check that ~i~ indeed has been changed, we print it.
  5) ~*p~ also prints the value of ~i~.
  #+end_quote

* ~*~ and ~&~ are inverse to one another

  - Address and indirection operator are /inverse/ to one another
    (i.e. they reverse each other's operation - applying both amounts
    to doing nothing).

  - Applying indirection ~*~ to an address /dereferences/ it.

  - Applying referencing ~&~ to a pointer extracts its address.

    #+name: inverseOps
    #+begin_src C
      // declaring and initializing
      int iResult = 75, *myPointer = &iResult;

      // print variable and dereferenced pointer
      printf("iResult = %d => *&iResult = %d\n",
             iResult, *&iResult);

      // print pointer and address of pointer
      printf("myPointer = %p => &*myPointer = %p\n",
             myPointer, &*myPointer);
    #+end_src

    #+RESULTS: inverseOps
    : iResult = 75 => *&iResult = 75
    : myPointer = 0x7fffb301bcdc => &*myPointer = 0x7fffb301bcdc

  - Applying ~*~ to the pointer takes us back to the original variable
    (dereferences the pointer)
    #+begin_example C
      j = *&i  // same as j = i
    #+end_example

* Pointers must be initialized

- Non-initialized pointers lead to invalid data or expressions.

- Pointer variables should always be initialized with:
  + another variable's memory address (e.g. ~&i~), OR
  + with 0, OR
  + with the keyword ~NULL~.

- Here are some /valid/ pointer initializations - ~printf~ uses the
  conversion specifier ~%p~ for pointers.
  #+name: ptrInit
  #+begin_src C :tangle ./src/ptrinit.c
    double *ptr1;  // declarations
    int *ptr2;
    int *ptr3;
    double x = 3.14; // initialize variable

    ptr1 = &x; // initialize with address
    ptr2 = 0;  // initialize with 0
    ptr3 = NULL; // initialize with NULL

    printf("%p %d %p\n", ptr1, ptr2, ptr3);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: ptrInit
  : 0x7ffe05acd058 0 (nil)

- Here are a few non-valid initializations:
  + can you tell why?
  + can you right the wrongs?
  #+begin_src C :results silent
    int i = 5; // declare and initialize i
    int *iPtr; // declare pointer iPtr

    iPtr = &i;   
    iPtr = 7;   
  #+end_src

- Solution:
  #+begin_src C :results output
    int i = 5; 
    int *iPtr;

    iPtr = &i;   // pointer initialized with memory address
    *iPtr = 7;   // value of i indirectly changed

    printf("%p %p %d\n", iPtr, &i, i);
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 0x7ffcea7a2cbc 0x7ffcea7a2cbc 7
