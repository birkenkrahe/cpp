#+end_quote

Yeah, right. In your dreams. I saw the blank stares of (almost)
everyone else. The truth: you weren't supposed to understand
anything - the learning doesn't happen when I'm talking but when
you're typing - when you're doing stuff either alongside me in class,
or (better) on your own.

** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/MDPI_2023_BIRKENKRAHE_poster.pptx.png]]

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

** Emacs tutorial
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 600px:
[[../img/emacs_learning_curve.jpg]]

- We're going to use Emacs to make our C programming life easier.

- But before it gets easier, it gets a little harder.

- This tutorial is meant to teach you Emacs as a text editor:
  [[http://tinyurl.com/EmacsTutorial][tinyurl.com/EmacsTutorial]]

- Open it in GitHub and then let's do it together.

- You will have to finish it on your own and submit the result.

- There are two videos by me covering the tutorial in 1 hour, and a
  bonus video with an advanced tutorial by Derek Banas ([[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwgb17bzeNyiUAM_PFME-IiNGvNIOficR][YouTube]]).

** Emacs and gcc home installation
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/emacs_gcc_installation.png]]

Some of you've got problems installing Emacs/gcc. Emacs should work
out of the box [[https://mirror.fcix.net/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-27/emacs-27.2-x86_64-installer.exe][from this link]] - you only need to add the =bin/=
directory to the =PATH=, and for gcc, if MSYS2 is too complex for you,
just [[https://www.codeblocks.org/][download Code::Blocks]] - that's an IDE that comes with gcc and
then you have it in the =PATH=. If you cannot make time to meet during
office hours and are in despair, you can hop on a Zoom call with
me. Or you can ask one of those who seem to have succeeded: @Cristian
Del Gobbo @Austin Swaim @Karley Wilson all did this at home, I
believe. I promise: By the end of the week, you'll have forgotten the
nightmare and will be ready for more!

** Hello world - again and again and again
[[../img/helloworld.png]]

- Dissecting "hello world".

** Review: variables, assignment, print formatting, Emacs (chat)

Check your understanding before or after class. Here are 11 questions
on stuff of last week. Some of these may return in a test.

- [ ] What must each variable in C have to specify the data it can hold?
  #+begin_notes
  A type, e.g. =int= or =float= or =char=, so that the memory can be reserved.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can multiple variables of the same type be declared in C?
  #+begin_notes
  They can be declared together in one line separated by commas.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What must happen to variable type declarations in relation to
  statements that use the variables?
  #+begin_notes
  The variable type declarations must precede statements that use the
  variables.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What does the code block "int height; height = 8;" do?
  #+begin_notes
  Declares an integer variable named height and assigns it the value 8
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How is a floating point value indicated when assigned to a =float=
  variable in C?
  #+begin_notes
  By including a decimal point and the letter f, e.g. ~profit = 200.f;~
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is unsafe about assigning a =float= to an =int= variable directly?
  #+begin_notes
  Because it can lead to loss of precision, and the compiler won't warn you.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is the purpose of the =%d= format specifier in C?
  #+begin_notes
  To print an integer value.
  #+end_notes
- [ ] What is the minimal =printf= statement to print the number ~1~ as an integer?
  #+begin_src C :results output :main yes :includes <stdio.h>
    printf("%d",1); // printing 1 as an integer with %d formatter
    printf("\n");
    printf("%s","1"); // printing "1" as a string with %s formatter
    printf("\n");
    puts("1"); // printing "1" as a string with the puts() function
  #+end_src
- [ ] What do three dots =...= at the end of a line in Emacs Org-mode
  usually mean?
  #+begin_notes
  If on a headline, bullet point or code block header, the section,
  bullet item, or code block will open and close with TAB (toggle).
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can you run an Emacs Org-mode code block?
  #+begin_notes
  With ~C-c C-c~ (CTRL + c CTRL +c)
  #+end_notes
- [ ] How can you copy, cut and paste in Emacs?
  #+begin_notes
  You can either use the preset keybindings to copy (~M-w~), cut (~C-w~),
  and paste (~C-y~), or you can switch to CUA-mode with (~M-x cua-mode~)
  and use Windows keybindings to copy (~C-c~), cut (~C-x~), and paste
  (~C-v~). In either case, you have to mark a region to work on (~C-SPC~).

#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 600px:
[[../img/programming_is_planning.png]]

- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/24410][See Canvas for the complete assignment]].

- *When writing programs, the writing comes last.*

- *Planning* the program comes first. This includes:
  1. Plan: Understanding what exactly is required.
  2. Pseudocode: Designing an algorithm with input/output.
  3. Process: Making a process diagram to illustrate the flow.
  4. Program: Coding in one or more languages.

- To illustrate this process see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/cpp/blob/main/org/assignments/sample.org][this "Hello, World!" sample]].

- I'll show you quickly how to create BPMN, flow and sequence diagrams
  at bpmn.io and mermaid.live.

** Bonus challenge: Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion (Canvas)
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 600px:
[[../img/programming_challenge.png]]

- Compute the temperature in degrees Celsius for a given temperature
  in degrees Fahrenheit.

- A complete solution includes:
  1. Plan (5 pt)
  2. Pseudocode (5 pt)
  3. Process (5 pt)
  4. Program (5 pt)

- Submit an Emacs Org-mode file with some or all of these aspects. Use
  Hello World sample file as a template if you like (e.g. to include
  images).

- For this bonus exercise, independence and diligence of execution is
  required and rewarded.

- You'll get my sample solution when you submit your solution.

* Week 7 - scanf and C operators
#+attr_html: :width 400px:
[[../img/week_7.webp]]

- [ ] Deadline: Mastering =printf= is [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/2107/assignments/25268][due Wednesday]]!
- [ ] Test 4 (=printf= and =scanf= coming this week)!
- [ ] Code along lecture & practice: =scanf=
- [ ] =scanf= practice
- [ ] Code along lecture & practice: C operators

* TODO Fast Fun Review: =printf=

1) What's the general format of the =printf= function?
   #+begin_example C
     printf ( {String} , {Variables} ) ; // String with format specifiers
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     int i = 3;
     //printf("I've got %d", i, "dogs\n");
     printf("I've got %d", i); printf(" dogs\n");
   #+end_src

2) What's the general format of the format specifier?
   #+begin_example C
     printf ( " %m.pX ", {Variable} );
   #+end_example

   #+begin_src C
     printf ("....|....|....|\n");
     printf ("%-10.5d.\n", 10 ); // integer, 10 fields left, precision 5
     printf (".%10.5f ", 10. ); // float, 10 fields right, precision 5
   #+end_src

3) How can you display ~10,000~ in scientific format (E-notation)?
   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %e\n", 10000); // warning! 0 output
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %e\n", 10000.); // precision issue
     printf("10,000 in E-notation: %.e\n", 10000.); // picture perfect!
   #+end_src
   
4) What's the specialty of the =%g= format specifier?
   #+begin_quote
   - =%g= handles floating-point numbers
   - =%g= automatically selects =%d= or =%f=
   - the case affects the symbol used
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000); // %g needs a floating-point number
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000.); // %g picks integer format
     printf("Integer: %g\n", 1000000.); // %g picks floating-point format
   #+end_src   

5) How many numbers can you print in one single =printf= statement?
   #+begin_quote
   As many as you like.
   #+end_quote

   #+begin_src C :main yes :includes <stdio.h> :results output :exports both :noweb yes
     printf("%d\n%f-%f\n%g\n%e\n%G\n(etc.)\n",
             100,10.,100.,1000.,1000.,1000000.);
   #+end_src
